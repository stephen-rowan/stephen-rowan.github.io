Providing services according to the needs and the timelines of other groups, while tapping into their budgets, is best delivered by a separate unit, perhaps a financially self-sufficient Workgroup.

We track tasks, not time - the task is what matters, not the time it takes a particular person to do it.

Currently, we provide a spreadsheet export of our GitHub Issues Board to track contribution, and we don't use Dework. There may be other ways to add our data to the Treasury system via the metadata of a fund request? But we have a diferent philosophy of what constitutes \"contribution\" than some other workgroups; and the Dework-based, hourly-rate approach doesn't fit it.

This led to a discussion about how the ecosystem could apply ethics and safety. This could take the form of local groups set within a broader, ecosystemwide ethics committee, so that there's coherence but also focused attention within groups, and freedom to do it according to their needs. Some ethics needs will be different.\n\nWe talked about how the Global Ethics Initiative fits in the Risk Management Framework. Specifically, gathering information from ecosystem groups, and collating general ethics research and information. It was suggested that setting standards for the Marketplace could ensure that spinoffs apply it (thought that's only effective if they care about getting on the Marketplace). We agreed to set up a common resource spreadsheet to start to gather research information and frameworks.\n\n\nWe discussed how the LATAM ambassadors can get involved in the Global Ethics Initiative. They could translate survey into Spanish and distribute. Maybe the Foundation funding can contribute to that.\nAmbassadors could have a presence at AI for Good and/or AGI and continue the fishbowl interviews (discussed proper ethics and informed consent form, and collecting metadata/contextual data",

There is also a welcome channel, but not everyone can see it - it might be best for it to remain restricted, but should any Onboarding members have access to it? ",

          "narrative": "AI Ethics Strategy drafting: \nwe discussed whether it would be a better idea to have a mix of experts and non-experts to collaborate on drafting the 3 strategies we want to complete. We noted that we have no proof of people's self-rated skill/knowledge level - but we agreed that it's fine, in this instance, to trust people on what they say about themselves. We discussed having 2 teams for each strategy - one for \"writing\" (3 people) and one for \"review/edit\" (2 people), and we suggested people should only sign up for one thing, to ensure that the work is shared out fairly between people. Ayo suggested min/max \"points\" level for each task - 24 for writing team and 12 for edit team -  (based on people's 1 to 10 \"how skilled are you\" self-rating), to ensure we get a reasonable level of expertise. Given the number of people interested, we have under-budgeted for this initiative; but we agreed we could move a bit of budget from another budget-line which we are unlikely to fully use, e.g. \"Communication management & community outreach\". \n\nCo-chair\nWe discussed if having a co-chair (a channel of communication between the AI Ethics WG and the Foundation's Global Ethics Initiative) is a good idea. The AI Ethics WG idea did come from them. Some of us feel we should try it and if it's not a great idea then we can shut it down. We will see what people think about it at the repeat meeting for other timezones on Wednesday. We created a signup space for those who have already done Q2 work on this, in page 2 of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vLC4ZIHO3WN-Ah9XwehRmbwLZAeePsxxYQXmLiiJLnQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWorkgroup membership:\nWe agreed that we DO want some kind of membership and a Discord tag, but we agreed that we will raise this at Wednesday's meeting and see if people have ideas on how to decide who is a member. We mentioned that meeting attendance isn't necessarily the same as participation, you can be quite passive in a meeting. We were unsure how to measure contribution: MINS tokens were suggested but not everyone agreed.\n\nQ3 WG Budget: \nWe need to submit a budget by 19th June. We will create an extra sheet on the planning spreadsheet where everyone can put in ideas for what we should do in Q3, and the budget that would be needed. The link will be shared on Discord.\n\nForum for Ethics discussion: \nIs it a great idea? People agreed that we should do it and that it should be open to all - but it needs to be specifically for discussion on ethics issues, not for workgroup organizational stuff. Moderators would be able to help enforce this - but we are not sure who CAN be a moderator, as it would give you moderator rights for the entire SNET discord server. LeeLoo, Duke, Gorga, and Clement are interested in being a moderator.\n\nFuture meeting:\nShould we meet again on the 24th and 26th of June for this quarter? We will see what people say about it on Wednesday and in Discord channel discussion.\n",

Following that, she also mentioned the need for a tweet sample from Mikasa that she could use as a template for writing content for the Spanish page.\n\nDiscussion and digging deep into the Q3 budget and projections. Kenichi opened the floor for suggestions and ideas will be welcomed with open arms.\n\nToday's meeting also navigated the axis of our substack newsletter and how articles will be published in the future.\n\nWe talked about our monthly newsletter; even though we aim to reach more people via email, we want individuals to choose whether they want to receive our emails so we don't clutter their inboxes.\n\nWe discussed how the community page articles will be paid for - it was suggested that drafts will be rewarded based on word count and performance. Any article that performs well over time will be rewarded from the points system allocation.\n\nLady Tempestt asks Kenichi about the Cogito articles from last year and the reward status, and then Kenichi says he'll reach out to Sandra.\n\nOn the other hand, Ayo spoke about the WWG onboarding process - he suggested that the WG could have an automated, seamless and faster onboarding process rather than leveraging human power. \n\nWe addressed how many people can get onboarded in a quarter! Since Ines raised questions like (will there be work for new people who are joining the WWG newly?). Ines suggests that we do onboarding at the end of each quarter to help us prepare future budgets and allocation to reward all contributions without having a second thought.\n\n",

He also stated that the form will help track new people coming to the WG and if they decide to become scribblers in the future. \n\nKenichi proposed the idea of tracking meeting matrices since read.ai doesn't track data such as attendance or the time people joined a meeting. Then he also emphasized  the importance of these data and how they will help in the WG in the future.\n\nFollowing that, he also proposed the idea of points delegations, where the scribblers and the scribes will be awarded an extra 10 points from the points system. These points can be delegated to other members of the workgroup to show love and support for their contributions towards your task(s), or whatever the case might be! \n\nWe also addressed and answered questions regarding the aspirants who took the WG test.\n\nLady Tempestt proposed the idea of implementing a rotational meeting facilitation system in the WWG, and then Kenichi cleared the air by saying that the scribes could facilitate meetings in his absence.\n\nDiscussion on dropping off inactive members with the scribbler tag; this discussion set the Thames on fire. As we fleshed out the tests of the aspiring writers, we desire to give room for new scribblers to join us, explore the world of AI, and also tell captivating stories through writing.\n",

We're almost done with the MVP. Obviously, you can see the code from the from the repos on the on our common GitHub. I think once the MVP is ready, we can open source the code. We're going through some testings for the UI. We have very minimal backend functionalities for now, just because there wasn't enough time to have a lot of the functionalities that we predicted. But still, there is something to be tested and something to be improved. I expect it to be open source in the next week and a half, depending on how fast I will get well. But it should be done very soon. After that, we will be doing some testing with other workgroup members. And I guess the reporting on that would be part of Q3, not Q2. So Q2 was mainly about getting an MVP out.\"   Ubio gave updates on his reasearch; \"what we did was simply to convert responses we got from Q1 into Figma. In Q2, We converted the responses and the things we could derive from those response into a design.  Prototype design.  so that's what we did for Q2. Q3 for us is about now taking that design to back to the community to engage and see what comes out of that.\"",

          "narrative": "AI Ethics Strategy drafting: \nLeeloo introduced herself and got the meeting started with discussion on the Strategy-drafting tasks, making reference to key takeaways from the AI Ethics WG 10th June Meeting (see meeting notes).\n\nTevo asked if there was a time/hour requirement for the Strategy-drafting tasks: none has been set yet. \n\nThe “Shadow-Mentoring” approach of the workgroup: it is the intent that less-experienced members of this workgroup are able to shadow more skilled people. LeeLoo referenced that there was already some considerable consent for this in the Monday meeting. Several thumbs-up to this regard with no dissenting leanings.\n\nLeeloo emphasized that there was room for anyone who wanted, to suggest additions or changes to the AI Ethics Workgroup stuff! spreadsheet in this meeting.\n\nBefore the strategy-drafting teams start wirk, there will be an orientation meeting for them with the GEI team from the Foundation: date TBC\n\nThere were also no different opinions to the selection points system suggested on Mon 10th by Ayo for those to work on the Strategy-drafting tasks.\n\nGorga asked if the spreadsheet is definitive as to what roles anyone will play in the strategy drafting tasks. Leeloo explained that  it isn't.\n\nCo-chair role:\nGuillermo suggested there should be a contributions-based criteria for the selection. Leeloo responded that it was okay if Guillermo wanted to put his name in the AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  because all the names got there on the basis of self-election. Leeloo outlined possible requirements and expectations of the co-chair. Duke and Clement added their names to the sheet, made their intentions known to be considered for the co-chair. There was some confusion here, since the signup sheet is actually to record who has done \"co-cahir\"-type work in quarter *two* of 2024 (April to June), but people are signing up to express interest for Quarter **three*.\n\nWorkgroup Membership\nthe meeting built on 10th June discussion. \nAyo suggested that meeting attendance could form a strong base for membership criteria. \n\nLeeLoo added that there may be instances where people contribute extensively asynchronously without attending the formal meetings. Ayo agreed with the addendum that it therefore falls on everyone to come up with hybrid all-encompassing membership criteria, and how they will be measured and applied. \n\nClement suggested a tiered membership.\n\nKenichi opined that core-membership should be based on technical contributions and to see if there could be more tiers than one. Core membership could be also goal orientated, which could solve both short term and long term concerns. Tags could also help. \n\nAyo suggested moving forward by adopting a simple two tier (first tier by intention, attendance and participation; second tier by proven, measured and accepted sync and or a-sync contributions). \n\nGuillermo pointed out that tasks or expected contributions are already stated in AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  Leeloo redirected that the excel sheet did only cover for the specifics of strategy drafting. \n\nQ3 Budget\nThe draft budget (sheet 3 of AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!) seemed to agree with everyone present in the meeting. Ayo suggested that it may be nice if the budget catered for something Leeloo later described as the \"information and resource archive guide\" - budget for a person or system that guarantees that everyone can be informed of all the ethics workgroup uncovers or documents as milestones or research are made.\n\nPrivate forum for Ethics discussion:\nEveryone agreed that we should be a forum for ethics discussion. After contributions from Clement, Kenichi, Leeloo and Ayo, the general consensus was that the forum will be open so everyone can follow the conversations therein, but only the 2-tier ethics workgroup member will be able to speak/chat in the forum. \n\nGuillermo suggested that the discussion and consensus be subjected to further conversations in subsequent meetings.\n\nNext meeting\nShould we meet again on the 24th and 26th of June for this quarter? 24th was favoured.",

Group members will test it. If it is plutocratic (i.e. 1 token 1 vote) we will not use.\n- How to publicise it on socials?\n- A 1-pager has been written to outline what the GEI is and ensure people understand what they are naming. Guillermo will transdlate to Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nAsia/Pacific Internet governance networks\n- Jenn is working with these - they have an initiative to learn about AI ethics. Can it be integrated with the GEI?\n- LeeLoo: education is a huge part of the GEI, but in the longer term. Current focus is on gathering the public's opinion. We can connect in a few months, when we move more towards education.\n\nScope of GEI survey\nClement: is it within sNET< or wider?\nHaley: It's for all voices, including those not in WEb3 groups.\nLeeLoo: I have a good grasp of marginalised communities that don't use much tech, and how to engage them.\n\nLicensing of materials collected from surveys and interviews\n - Agree Creative Commons all the way!\n - CC BY-NC sharealike preferred\n - Do we licence material to individual interviewees? Always best to licence to a person, not an organisation, since organisations change; but this could be fiddly to manage and a problem if people do not want to be named.\n- To be discussed further\n \n\n",

The team discussed the use of routine tools and resources such as Discord SNET server, Zoom, and Google Docs. Ayo suggested discussing the budget first due to time constraints and the relevance of the topic. The team discussed the quarterly budget, focusing on the Agix token prices and its impact on the budget.\n\nThey calculated the approximate value in dollars and compared it to the previous quarter's budget. The discussion revolved around the allocation of the budget across different workgroups and guilds. There was a focus on ensuring fair distribution and maximizing the value of the available budget, with concerns raised about excessive allocation to certain areas and the potential impact on the community.\n\nThe team discussed reducing hourly rates and increasing work hours to maintain the total budget at $30. There was a debate on the appropriate hourly rate and the amount of work required for different tasks, leading to a decision to continue the discussion asynchronously on Discord. Gavriel proposed compensating core contributors with $4,000 for 15 hours of strategy development and discussion, with each core member expected to contribute 5 hours.\n\nBilly suggested reducing the hours to 5 or 6 per week for three core members, and emphasized the need to learn and adjust as they go. Gavriel and others discussed the complexity of developing a knowledge management and dissemination strategy, emphasizing the need for strategic alignment across the community. There was a debate about the role of delegation and the overlap with the Knowledge Base workgroup.\n\nBilly and Gavriel addressed concerns about the budget. Ayo clarified the distinction between weekly meetings and workshops, and encouraged everyone to access the strategy budget proposal document for further discussion and input.",

He plans to integrate recommendations from the last meeting summary and aims to complete this by the next meeting.\n\nAyo to create Initiative and Contribution Framework Document.\nAyo emphasized that while the document framework has been established, the focus now shifts from creation to active contribution. Given its comprehensive nature involving multiple sections, Ayo stressed that completing it shouldn't fall solely on one person but should be a collective effort. He highlighted the importance of avoiding redundancy within the document, noting specific sections like onboarding influenced by Sucre n Spice's work and strategy linked to other aspects. Ayo underscored the need for initiative and widespread contribution, proposing a timeline dedicated to collaborative contributions to finalize the document efficiently.\n.\n\nDiscussion item: How do we get more African countries to join the guild and participate in the program? (take outs from suggestions of previous meeting - surveys, merchandise, virtual meets, physical workshops, etc).\n\nClement recapped the last meeting's takeaways, including conducting surveys and collaborating with other institutions to promote the guild and SingularityNet initiative. He requested input on potential partner organizations and announced that he will create a document for these recommendations in the second phase of research. Clement also reminded the guild to contribute resources to support individual projects that align with the guild's objectives.\n\nMarketing Initiatives for the Guild\nAyo and Clement discussed marketing initiatives for the Guild, including incentivizing quality people to join and creating a template for sourcing individuals from other African countries. Ayo proposed forming a team to work on clear-cut marketing initiatives. He suggested we can have a four person’s team for that.\nSo the team comes with a series of marketing initiatives for the next meeting that we all can deliberate on and decide how to move forward.\n\nBounty to upload our past meeting summaries\nClement  suggested uploading past meeting summaries to a summary tool developed by the archives group and proposed offering a bounty for volunteers interested in this task. Ayo and Issac volunteered to do that.\n\nAMA Session Update\n\nWe reviewed the successful AMA session, which engaged five countries, with active participation from Kenya, Cameroon, and Ghana, and established contact with Rwanda.\n Ayo highlighted the need for a larger budget due to the extensive effort involved, with team members dedicating over seven hours each. Contributions from Ese, Clement, Onizi, and Ayo were praised. Clement emphasized customizing innovations to fit African needs, such as developing an African-specific language model. Overall, the session achieved its goals of outreach and meaningful AI discussions for Africa.\n\nQ3 Budget Updates\n\nClement noted that recent token prices are unfavorable, necessitating budget adjustments. Sucre suggested postponing final Q3 budget decisions until the treasury clarifies the percentage cut on July 10th, which is expected to be between 23% and 30%. While waiting, Sucre recommended identifying items to potentially reduce. Clement agreed to keep the Q3 budget pending, and Ayo concurred, especially since many guild members were absent. Clement emphasized that swift consent from the first batch of guilds shows strong support for core initiatives, allowing for a focused and strategic budgeting approach essential for solidifying the African guild's structure.",

          "narrative": "Attendee Count: 19 unique individuals, 20 devices.\n\nMeeting Narrative:\n\nMembership Criteria: Vani referenced the previous meeting - people do want membership, and a 2 tier system has been suggested but not yet agreed, and [7:33] mentioned her impression that hierarchical membership structures appeal to some, but not all. LadyTempestt [9:20] agreed with keeping it simple, and starting by giving tag to people who have attend meetings. Aetherblade suggested in Chat that there's a difference between people who look and people who contribute. Vani suggested [9:47] instead of meeting attendance, use contribution/posting in Discord, since it's hard to find a meeting time that everyone can do, but Discord posting can be in own time. After mention of several options, consent (no objections) to giving tag to anyone who comments in the WG Discord, and reassess later if we find we need tiers. Soundwaves confirmed that adding the tag to those active in Discord can be automated using the ME6 bot that we already have [9:20].\n\nStrategy-drafting: [11:47] the 3 writers and 2 editors for each strategy have all confirmed (see AI Ethics Workgroup stuff! spreadsheet). There will be an orientation meeting with Esther and Haley for each team, to define scope and discuss content; then teams will self-organise. Completion dates: third week in July (Fri 19th) for writing and 2nd August 2024 for editing.\n\nQ2 Budget and Spend [22:08]: see \"AI Ethics WG Quarter 2 payments and budget rec\" spreadsheet. Vani explained how this doc takes the Q2 budget written by Peter, Esther and herself, and fits it to the work that's actually been done, including the strategy drafting work (with more money than originally planned); and Vani's own work in setting up the WG. No objections. BUT it was noted that Colleen did some co-ordinating work in Q2 that needs to be added.\n\nA Co-chair[26:33] Consensus is reached, the WG is to have a Co-chair who will work with the Global AI Ethics Initiative (GEI) team (Haley, Esther) and with LeeLoo as the other Co-Chair, but from the Foundation side.\n\nSelecting Co-ordination Roles for Q3 [29:58]: A Cryptpad document will be created so anyone/everyone can drop anonymous comments in favour (or otherwise) of the “contestants” for various posts including the Co-chair role, to help us decide. \nThose interested: \nCo-chair: Colleen, Clement, Duke, Vani.\nWG Reportbacks: Jenn\nAsync work support: Love, Gorga, Malik, Slate.\nWG internal management: Kenichi, Sucre, Ayo.\n\nQ2 quarterly report, and Budget for Q3 [41:28]: Have been submitted, Members of the WG who are Core Contributors are reminded to submit consent forms for the WG budget and for other G and WG budgets.\n\nForum for AI ethics discussions [42:12]: Peter will create the forum. Clement signified interest in moderator role, which will be rewarded from the contingency budget.\n\nWhen to meet [54:47]: Meeting time will move to 14:00 UTC, and next meeting is 8th July 2024.\n\nMeeting ends: 59:17.\n\nNote: this meeting summary significantly amended and tidied by Vani - issues such as lack of clarity in narrative section and some things incorrectly documented; not including things as decisions/action items; not using decision rationales",

The meeting also focused on the points system allocation from June and Zealy updates.\n\nThe meeting started with Kenichi welcoming, and then he mentioned that we only had a few items to discuss on the agenda. He started by citing the WWG Q2 journey and how we can move forward progressively.\n\nSecondly, he mentioned the points system allocation from June and the reward balance in the Treasury. He was impressed with the performances from June, and he pointed out that whether we increase Q3 deliverables or not or our budget gets slashed, we can also visit the points system reserve to draw more pools. He also shed light on the Q3 budget concerns and the need for members to consent to the budget proposal after the meeting.\n\nFollowing a discussion with the points system, Kenichi shared his screen, and he showcased the publication matrix on Medium. In the month of June, 6 articles were published on the ecosystem page, which amassed 803 reads, amounting to 1.5k views. Owing to the fact that the SingulularityNET community page is still in its infancy, the page has also amassed over 133 views, 71+ reads, and 17 followers. Without hesitation, Advance Ameyaw suggested that we strive to increase the community page engagement and also attract new followers by implementing a system, where people can invite friends and get points. Kenichi appreciated his contribution and said that we already have a system that works, which is Zealy itself, and there is an invite-friend quest on the board!\n\nProgressively, we moved over to the Zealy side of things, and Kenichi announced that the current sprint is 10 days away from ending. Following that, we discussed the X Spanish page; Kenichi also mentioned that he'd love to know how Mikasa and Ines are tracking their activity hours — the need for tracking activity hours is essential because it is part of the concerns that were raised in Q2. He also added that the Scribes and Scribblers should try to attend the governance call whenever concerns like this are raised.\n\nKenichi emphasized the need for having the “pupil tag,” while stating that we give the tag to people who attend our meetings.  Since our Dework channel is private, people with the pupil tag will be able to see our channel and follow up on discussions around the WWG. More so, Kenichi headed over to the “Scribbler Onboarding Form” to see how many people had filled out the form. We spotted a new response, and we would reach out! Momentarily, Mikasa asked Kenichi why we paused the “biweekly cohort session.” Kenichi cleared the air by saying that people preferred having their onboarding session during the meeting rather than editing documents, he also added that the WWG might reinstate the cohort session once again.\n\nAs a matter of finality, Kenichi announced the launch of the new “Mindplex Series: Super AI.” Lastly, he stated that he will work on the first series while other Scribblers will write on the future series yet to come. \n",

Onyeka suggests a cross-country community approach while being mindful of the program’s budget. \n\nCreative quarterly bounties: To be discussed further for ideation in the next meeting.\nCross collaboration with AI Ethics WG: A SNET African Guild AI Ethics Expo, a collaborative event effort being accomplished alongside the AI Ethics workgroup.\nTown Hall Updates: Takers asked for who will do the townhall updates\nOnboarding Structure Update: Sucre urged people to make further contributions to the onboarding structure document.\nAMA Session Update: Ese reports that the AMA preparations are in the marketing phase and everything on queue.\nQ2 Report and Q3 Budget: Link shared so everyone can see, read and drop comments where they deem necessary. Duke sheds light on the circumstances of the report completion. Also budget approval is not automatic. All fingers advised to be crossed.\nAOB: Sucre wanted to understand why the Telegram group isn’t as active as before. Duke responded that it is difficult to discuss operational subjects on Telegram as there are people in the Telegram group who have yet to onboard to the Ambassador Program itself, which is a prerequisite to being a member. A concern was raised about why we are still using Google Meet and not Zoom. Resolved with an action item.\nClosing: All hands to be on deck for the furtherance of the objectives of the guild. Appreciation to everyone about how the AG call was free from tension that could have come from the Governance call.",

Following that, Cjfrankie asked Lady Tempestt, and Devon to share updates on their task, which they did!\n\nKenichi hops on the call and takes the wheel. As Q2 2024 concludes, the WWG reflects on our achievements in Q2. With screen sharing, Kenichi shares the community page progress — so far, four authors have published their articles, namely Ines, Devon, Cjfrankie, and Lady Tempestt.\n\nProgressively, Kenichi shared an update from the Zealy and Notion sides of things, highlighting our journey and the progress the workgroup has achieved in the last few months. We also talked about our substack and how to implement a comment session for people to voice their opinions as they read the monthly recap. Kenichi also pointed out that we have a French speaker in the person of Emmanuel Isaac — going forward, he will be managing the WG French page on X.\n\nMomentarily, Onize, who recently took the WWG, asked, “Can aspirants who didn't pass the WWG test still take on tasks?” This question was followed up with Kenichi’s reply, saying that the WG might implement the “taskforce mechanism.” The idea is to enable people without the Scribbler tag who possess certain skills like graphics, to be able to pick up tasks and earn rewards for their contributions.\n\nWe reached our Q2 KPIs through collaborative efforts - see y'all next quarter!\n\nWe had discussions centered around the points system and how to increase transparency  — Lady Tempestt, who emphasized making the system more transparent because many people in the community seem to have little knowledge about how it works. Kenichi shares the metrics, and what’s being measured, and how contributors earn the allocation. In view of the points system allocation and how to be more transparent, Lady Tempestt suggests that the WG could write a detailed document that highlights how the points are assigned and why people get a certain share.\n\nThe meeting ended with Kenichi announcing the trivia session that would be held today, noting that everyone should get ready for a thrilling session. Everyone expressed their thoughts, and we talked about the current people leading the trivia and how they could make room for other people to win; we all laughed, and we called it a day! See y'all next quarter.\n",

          "narrative": "On “naming”,\n- How to frame it? This quarter, we are trialling consent decision-making processes, so we need a proposal. Should it be \"change the name\" or \"don't change it\"? Which one is used would probably affect the results, since generally people tend to agree with a proposal rather than argue against it.  Proposal is that it should be a 2 step process: “Change the name” but without specifying what to change it to, and then decide what the new name should be afterwards.\n- We need a context-setting doc to explain what decision is being made, and maybe collate some pros and cons that have been shared in the community already. These should be sourced (i.e. not our opinions, but things that have been said up to now, ideally with links). Onboarding WG can do this.\n- Citizen OS (the proposed decision making tool for this decision) seems quite intuitive, so altho Onboarding could also look at creating a video walkthru of it, this is probably not needed.\n- We didn’t agree how we will progress the naming decision, or who will share it with Core Contributors and when.\n\nOn tooling,\n- We discussed using Citizen OS or Unanimous tool (both free and OS) for the Naming and Q2 Budget decisions, and agreed on Citizen OS\n- Unanimous could give us a demo: Week of 22nd April?\n- People could also use both of these tools in their workgroups - either for real decisions, or simulated ones\n- We didn’t decide whether we will try to use 1 account or everyone create their own.\n- We agreed that whenever a tool is used, the users should collect some feedback on how it went. - There was discussion of what the criteria should be to assess a tool - suggestions are being drafted in the doc Gov Sandbox Turn #1 - Testing Tools but we didn’t finalise it or decide how and where to share the criteria.\n- Concerns were raised on privacy/transparency - we don’t know who can see people's responses in Citizen OS and agreed we need to find out, and tell people, before we ask them to use the tool.\n\nOn Q2 budget:\n- We agreed there should be individual decisions on each WG’s budget. There are 14 WGs in total, but not all of them will need to submit a budget request for Q2 due to rise in token price and/or budget elements from Q1 carrying over, so it will be fewer then 14 decisions.\n- There was discussion of whether we should set a deadline for all budgets to be submitted and only ask Core Contributors to decide once all the budgets are in, because then we can make informed assessment of the budget allocation overall; or whether it should be a rolling process to accommodate WGs who submit their budget late. We decided to set a deadline for Q2 budgets to be submitted, but didn’t agree on the date.\n- Briefly discussed what the criteria should be for making a decision on a budget, and what should be shared with Core Contributors about this; but didn’t make a decision on this. Carry over to next Governance meeting.\n- We started drafting in the Governance Sandbox:Tool Testing doc how the decision will be set up in Citizen OS. Agreed Guillermo will set it up but we didn’t agree a date - just some time in April.\n\nTo be discussed further in a Treasury meeting:\n- whether budget approval should be related to the WG’s quarterly report for the previous quarter, and whether they have done what they said they would do?\n- what level of flexibility a WG should have to reassign their agreed budget in response to changing conditions. Not definitely agreed on?\n",

But from the Ambassador Program, especially from the Research Guild, which this is concerned, while any of these projects are individual suggestion and individual proposal, it's still technically for the ambassador program.

This is coming from the entire guild. Then that will give it much more credibility, which is what we should be looking for.

Ayo encouraged all core contributors to attend their consent-ing responsibilities.\n\nQ3 in Perspective \nAyo explained that there are only two objectives for the Guild in Q3, one to understand the need of the program and the perspective in which contributors in the program expects the Guild to function, two is to facilitate a workshop in partnership with the Writer and Video Workgroups and Marketing Guild. Ayo shared that the Q3 report is based on the outcome  of two objectives of the Guild.\n\nDiscussion on Survey Ideas and Participation\nThere are two open documents to which people are expected to contribute. The Possible Survey Questions [Strategy Guild] and the Strategy Guild Working Document.\n\nDiscussion on Tools and Meeting Time\nAfter contributions from Ayo and Clement, consensus was that the Guild will be open to exploring whatever tools can best serve the interest and uniqueness of the Guild. The meeting will also remain at 4pm UTC weekly Mondays.\n\n\nDiscussion on Guild Leadership and Rotating Facilitation\nPeter broached the discussion of Guild Lead and Facilitation rotation, Ayo acknowledged the vote of confidence from Gorga, who suggested that Ayo should be the Guild Lead, it was decided that because of time it should be put into the 22nd July Guild meeting agenda so it can be properly discussed.\n",

Momentarily, Gorga unmutes his mic, and he appreciates everyone for their support and love.\n\nFollowing that, Mikasa expresses her concerns about the unpublished meeting summaries! July is wrapping up, and the Scribes need to deliver the “SNET Ambassador Program Recap.” Cjfrankie suggests we can get some of the summaries from the meeting tool by navigating down the site to download the PDF version.\n\nToday's meeting marked the presence of Eveline Trinite, who introduced herself and showcased her keen interest in the WG. After the introduction, Mikasa said that she would reach out to her to help her get involved in the WG. In a flash, Merryman also introduced him, and he expressed interest in contributing to the WG.\n\nCjfrankie also put Advanced Ameyaw in the spotlight by asking him how he felt while taking the WG’s TEST, and he also hinted that the TEST was quite hard for him! Moved with enthusiasm, Advance asked a question “How do the WWGs operate?.” And if they also collaborate with the spinoffs, Cjfrankie cleared the air by highlighting the WWG goals and mission. He also pointed out that the WG has worked with other spin-offs like “Cogito.” We have also written a couple of drafts for Cogito, and we have close contact with Sandra.\n\nMEETING AGENDA: Lady Tempestt emphasized the need for having a structured agenda for our weekly meeting to help us stay organized.\n\nAyo, from the Strategy Guild, talked about the forthcoming workshop scheduled for the 29th of May, 2024. According to Ayo, the workshop needs 2-3 persons who would represent the WWG in the workshop, and then Mikasa, Cjfrankie, and Gorga expressed their interests.\n",

We kicked things off from the Zealy side of things; thankfully, the Zealy sprint has ended, however, the random winners🏆 haven't been announced yet. Momentarily, Kenichi added that the next sprint should start immediately — July 22nd, to be precise. Kenichi also suggested that we should repeat some quests from last quarter; he also hinted that the last sprint had a low turnout rate and a decline in participation compared to other springs.\n\nDework update: Cjfrankie and Devon share an update on the current tasks assigned to them.\n\nFollowing that, Kenichi called the Scribbler's attention to the community page, and he added that the community page is out of draft. He also encouraged the Scribes to source for more drafts. Kenichi added that he would dig into the inventory to source old, unpublished articles pending the time when new drafts will be ready! \n\nFrom a bird’s-eye view, July looks like a transformative month for the WWG: we crossed our KPI of 200 followers on the ambassador's medium page, but we're not stopping there! We need more people to engage with our content.\n\nPeer Review: Following a discussion with the writer's WG test submission, Kenichi still emphasized the need for using suggestion mode to edit drafts so that the writers can see what changes were made. Kenichi also commended Nengi for her test;  momentarily, he announced that Nengi is now officially a Scribbler and that he will get the Scribbler tag for her. He also encouraged the Scribes to keep sharing the WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form since we haven't reached our onboarding number for Q3.\n\nFollowing the revamped marketing guild, marketing wants to join forces with the writer's workgroup. To this effect, Kenichi proposed a giveaway or airdrop initiative where people with the highest Zealy points get rewarded with an \n",

Worked thru the GitHub board, beginning with \"in progress\" items.\n\nThe 3 strategy drafts (research strategy, ethics strategy, knowledge management strategy) are written, and are now handed over to their respective editing teams, with a deadline of 2nd August.\n\nDiscussion on how to pay the strategy-writing teams. They each have a total of $300, originally planned as $100 per person - but what is fair when not everyone in each team took part? Should someone be docked money for adding their input a couple of (weekend) days late? If people didn't contribute anything, or contributed less,  to their group's doc, what should they be paid, if anything? How should we approach things if someone was ill? etc. Some discussion on the importance of deadlines vs the importance of a degree of flexibility; the need for communicating any blockers to the rest of your team; and the difficulties and rewards of asynchronous working in small teams. \n\nThe Knowledge Management team's decision was made very rapidly in the meeting itself; the Ethics strategy team have had some prior discussion and are not all agreed, but they may prefer to leave it as it is and avoid a dispute; the Research strategy team seem to be agreed.\n\nWe ran through the work that has been done by the WG admin roles (Jen''s reportback to the GEI; internal WG management; WG async support, co-chair, and co-chair mentor). See GitHub Board for details.\n\nLadyTempestt as async work support raised the point that it can be hard sometimes to \"be in the middle\" and not to intervene.\n\nDiscussed what Clement's fee should be for AI Ethics Forum moderation.\n\nDiscussed how to fund documenting the GEI meetings as well as our WG meetings.\n\nAgreed to pay Colleen for the small amount of co-ordination work she did in Q2.\n\nDiscussed open tasks in the Q3 budget - \"AI Ethics conversations\" and \"Interviewing\".\n\nNoted that our Q3 budget line for \"Producing educational resources\" will have to be moved to Q4 due to budget-fitting. Also noted that Education WG is making some video learning resources on AI this quarter, so if we do decide to do this in Q4 we will need to be aware of what Education WG has produced, and be sure not to duplicate.\n\nDiscussed possible tasks for AGI-24 conference, August 13th-16th; and for the pre-event on 7th August. To be funded via the match-funding of this WG's Q2 budget that Esther secured from the Foundation. We noted that nobody from the WG is now going to Seattle in person due to high flight prices, so we will focus on virtual activities - fishbowl interviews; a virtual chillout room; etc. Noted that due to short timescale, we need people who don't need training or support to do these tasks; and noted the need for people to be honest about their skills.\n\n",

The discussion also touches on the majority of the budget being allocated to recurring operational work.\n\nFeedback on African Guild progress\n\nDuke Peter asks for feedback on the African Guild's progress and receives positive comments from Clement Umoh.\n\nDuke Peter leads a discussion on the progress of the African Guild, with Ese Williams expressing satisfaction with the experience and suggesting improvements in organization and time management. \n\nDuke Peter seeked opinions on the pace of progress and coordination, while also considering the idea of providing giveaways for consistent meeting attendance. \n\nMember concerns: Discussion on AAG Token and Guild Outreach Initiative\n\nEse Williams expresses confusion about the AAG token and its legitimacy, prompting Clement Umoh to caution against engaging with it. Duke Peter shares plans for the African Guild AI Ethics Expo as the first outreach initiative and encourages input from the group.

The group briefly discussed the waiting room setting before transitioning to preparing for the meeting, with Felix seeking to create a new MyRobot for the session. Felix then redirected a marketing proposal to the Marketing Guild, advising the presenter to seek support and feedback from the appropriate channels.\n\nThe main agenda of the meeting was a retrospective on the previous ambassador's governance decisions. Felix emphasized the need for participants to share their experiences, provide feedback, and make suggestions for future governance processes. The meeting aimed to gather insights and reflections on the decision-making processes and budget allocations for the previous quarters, with a focus on experimenting with new approaches and learning from past experiences.\n\nFelix and Guillermo discussed the effectiveness of the budget and governance decisions, highlighting improvements and challenges faced by the work groups. They emphasized the importance of finding consensus and addressing issues within the governance structure.\n\nThe team discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the recent decision-making process, highlighting the positive aspects of involving core contributors and the need for better communication and understanding of the consent process. Additionally, there was a call for a more defined process for new workgroups to emerge. The team also discussed the importance of awareness in onboarding and mentoring, as well as the need to identify and support individuals who may be struggling within the ecosystem. They also considered potential overlaps with the Strategy Guild and the need for clear guidelines to avoid duplication of efforts.\n\nFinally, the team discussed the implementation of Project Hermes, a messenger system between different groups, and the role of navigators to facilitate communication and sharing of best practices. They also considered potential overlaps with the Strategy Guild and the need for clear guidelines to avoid duplication of efforts. The team discussed the idea of incorporating the key learnings from the retrospective sessions into the Town Hall by hosting breakout rooms to engage the audience in interactive discussions. They considered the potential topics for the breakout rooms and the logistics of organizing them.\n\nChapters & Topics:\n\nCasual Conversation and Technical Settings\nAmbassadors SingularityNET and Felix discuss technical settings and the waiting room feature, with Felix expressing uncertainty about its necessity. The conversation then turns to Felix's current location in the countryside, where he shares his experience of observing birds and their natural behavior. The group briefly discusses the waiting room setting before transitioning to preparing for the meeting.\n\nDiscussion on Marketing Proposal and Retrospective on Ambassador's Governance\nFelix redirects a marketing proposal to the Marketing Guild, suggesting it as a more suitable platform for the proposal. He then introduces the topic of the retrospective on the previous ambassador's governance decisions, highlighting the importance of gathering feedback and suggestions for future governance processes from the participants.\n\nGovernance and Decision-Making Discussion\nFelix and Guillermo reflect on the impact of governance decisions on work groups, acknowledging the improvements made while also addressing challenges and the need for consensus. They discuss the tools and processes used for decision-making and suggest creating a system for smoother transitions in leadership roles within the work groups.\n\nDiscussion on Governance and Participation\nVani proposes discussing Love's chat input, and Felix and Peter share their perspectives on the positive and negative aspects of governance, including the need for clearer rules and the challenges of short timelines and low core contributor turnout. They also discuss the management of objections and the need for more concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\nBudget Proposals, Treasury Rules, Workgroup Centralization, and New Workgroup Process\nSucrenSpice addresses the need for improved timing and accountability in budget proposals, proposes the implementation of budget limits, and raises concerns about centralized workgroups lacking leadership. Furthermore, there is a suggestion for a more defined process for the emergence of new workgroups.\n\nFeedback on Decision-Making Process\nVani and Felix review the recent decision-making process, acknowledging the benefits of involving core contributors and the need for clearer communication and understanding of the consent process. Vani also suggests gathering feedback from core contributors who did not participate to understand their reasons for non-participation.\n\nFeedback and Suggestions\nFelix and Ayo share their perspectives on the program, highlighting the positive aspects like the welcoming environment and the concept of decentralization. Ayo expresses concerns about the lack of clear direction and suggests the need to identify and support individuals who may be struggling within the ecosystem. He emphasizes the importance of addressing subtle issues that can impact motivation and enthusiasm.\n\nDiscussion on Onboarding and Mentoring\nAyo emphasizes the significance of awareness in onboarding and mentoring, while Felix acknowledges the warm environment at Avian and the need for effective talent identification. Felix also welcomes Ayo to Singularity and encourages his unbiased perspective. Kenichi then joins the discussion, expressing that everything went well. \n* Engagement and Participation in the Community\n\nKenichi's Review and Suggestions\nKenichi emphasizes the positive increase in community engagement and the challenges of managing a larger number of contributors. He suggests using metrics to determine decision-making quorums based on core contributors' engagement and proposes a survey to understand why some core contributors don't participate. Additionally, he advocates for better information dissemination on the server and the need for individuals to guide others to relevant information.\n* Frequency of meetings\n\nDiscussion on the Need for a Workgroup Lead Role\nFelix and Peter emphasize the necessity of a workgroup lead role and regular check-ins for workgroups. Guillermo supports the idea and proposes the concept of a representative or \"D-Rep\" to facilitate communication and coordination across workgroups, highlighting the need for a fluid and dynamic structure.\n* Role of Navigators in the Ecosystem\n\nPlanning for Town Hall Breakout Rooms\nFelix and Peter propose integrating the key learnings from the retrospective sessions into the upcoming Town Hall by hosting interactive breakout rooms. They discuss the potential topics for the breakout rooms, such as decision-making processes and communication across departments, and consider the logistics of organizing the breakout rooms. Peter expresses willingness to try the new approach and suggests outlining the topics in advance.\n* Timing and Time Schedule on Decision-Making\n\nDiscussion on Project Hermes and Navigator Role\nGuillermo Lucero Funes suggested the name \"Project Hermes\" for the messenger system and emphasized the need for effective communication and collaboration. Felix and SucrenSpice discussed the navigator role, highlighting the importance of checking in with different groups and sharing best practices. Ayo raised concerns about potential overlaps with the Strategy Guild and the need for clear guidelines to ensure smooth program operations.\n* Project Hermes\n",

If we have the wallet address where we would send the NFT, then we could equally just have a whitelist without having the NFTs\nWe discussed possibility of continuing to use Google Forms, but noted that it can be very gameable unless we ask for email addresses to be sure people are only completing the form once, and that they are Core Contributors.\nNo decision made - need to carry this over to a future meeting\n\nWhat decisions do we think will be made in Q3?\n- Q3 budgets, obviously\n- Also, looks like we will need to decide how people get the Core Contributor role. At the moment, self-nomination is enough, but we felt there might be potential problems with that - we need to decide whether we want to have criteria, and if so, how strictly we want to enforce them.\nWe agreed that we want to keep some element of “the human touch” in how we decide who is “in” - i.e. it shouldn’t be just rigidly done in terms of a set of criteria - but that how the “human touch” should work probably needs refining.\nWe agreed that there might be more to say on this topic and it should be carried over to the next meeting on 28th May\n\nTo carry over to next meeting:\nNaming decision (do we keep the name Core Contributor?)\nWhat decision making method should we use in Q3\nWhat decisions will we make in Q3\n(from previous meeting) retrospective on Q2’s governance experiments, and writing it up\n\nNext meeting, Tues 21st May, is the budget consent discussion\nNext ordinary meeting is Tues 28th May.\n\n",

Feedback suggested that a) WGs do need to break their budgets down clearly enough that people know what they plan to spend, but b) there ideally needs to be scope for flexibility and responsiveness, so maybe it should not be overly specific. The intention matters more than the details? (e.g. you would say “we want to create resources to help onboard people” rather than “we will make 2 videos and 1 infographic with XYZ content)\n- Should a budget be linked to a quarterly report? How?\n- Should submitting a quarterly report be compulsory in order to have your budget approved? Should the quarterly report be submitted at the same time as submitting a budget, and/or actually linked and referred to in your budget sheet?  And - are there standards for what a quarterly report should be like? If it’s really perfunctory and not very informative, can it lead to a budget request being refused?\n- And (on the question of flexibility and responsiveness) - how closely does a WG need to stick to its proposed budget?

Firstly, Emmanuel Isaac and Mikasa shared an update from the Twitter management side of things. Emmanuel said that he has submitted the KPI for Q3, and he has created a draft for the content calendar which will start rolling out next week.\n\nSecondly, Kenichi raised a discussion on the recent test taken by WWG aspirants — he also pointed out that the aspirants should enable suggestion mode to reflect the actual changes that they made. The aspirants should also open edit access and follow the exact instructions that were mentioned in the test. So far, three scribblers have reviewed the test done by Nengi and Gorga, while Kenichi will do the aggregate to show their total score, and if they reach the threshold, they will be welcomed to the WG.\n\nKenichi also pointed out some slips from Slate's article “Medical Advisor Roundtable: Chronic Disease” and why he still needs to make changes to the document. Kenichi also emphasized the need for more Twitter threads, and he also pointed out that Twitter threads aren't exclusive to Mikasa; other scribblers can find interesting topics and then showcase them during meetings.\n\nWe discussed “timestamped video shorts\", and how we can embed them within our Medium articles to increase traction and engagement. Kenichi added that he will create a list of all the pending drafts and then give the video to WG. Devon asked, “What kind of videos?” Kenichi answered by saying that the shorts would be created from existing videos and would be no longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds. Lady Tempestt added that the scribblers should decide which part is the most captivating in a video, and then the video gets a timestamp. \n\nWe started a thrilling discussion centered around Zealy; thankfully, the current sprint is ending in a few days! Kenichi also shared insider tips on the sprinters' matrix;  the current sprint has 36+ participants. We also talked about restructuring the Zealy rewards. Here’s the breakdown: the top 5 get $30 each, the next 5 get $20 each, the next 10 get $10 each, and 10 random people will earn $10 each. This decision was made to incentivize more people for their participation and time.\n\nAs a matter of finality, Ayo added that we should always give consent to new proposals to enable them to pass. He also spilled the beans by giving us insider tips from the Strategy Guild. The guild is looking forward to hosting a workshop that will involve the Writers' WG and video WG in their pipeline — more updates will be coming soon!",

The way the platform will interact with social media is that there is an API contact and some of these APIs need some time to be approved. We got approval from Google, YouTube API, and we're waiting for X (Twitter) and for Facebook. We're doing some testing. We are polishing the UI. We will do a push for the GitHub. Probably today or tomorrow we should be doing a push. Rojo shared a major challenge: he came across  an open source project called Mixpost. This open source project is basically like an open source replica of Buffer.com, which does social media automation and social media dashboarding and team coordination, which is what the Guild is aiming for. He is currently testing this solution and the major issue is if while testing this solution, it does prove itself to be as good as what he seen so far, would it be a good idea to actually use this solution and part of the funding for our project so far would go to hosting and maintaining this solution rather than keeping working on the previous one and trying to improve it to reach the same level because our aim from the beginning was to build an open source project for this exact case. And it is sad that we had to build so far all of these things and just to realize that there was a solution already available, but it might be a more judicious and a smarter thing to do is to actually build upon previous open source solution that are already existing.

The whole  group took alook at the video and commended the work but the major concern was the compensation for the work, Lordkizzy made emphasis on the tight budget the video WG are currently working with for Q3 and says it will be outrageous to pay $50 per person ($100) for a clip when we have a budget of $20 each for 12 clips, Lily dropped in an mentioned that the entire video was created from scratch and we should conside it as a long video rather than a clip, slate also indicated that once we pay this out someone can perform similar task and be expecting the same pay which is not feasible for us, so Lordkizzy suggested we compensate their efforts with $30 each and we decided to put it to a poll since the conversation was taking a while.

          "narrative": "Our first meeting in August started strong with a warm welcome greeting from Kenichi, and momentarily, he surfed the WG’s dework board to cite the tasks in progress — Gorga, Ines, and Devon gave us an update on their tasks. Following that, Kenichi emphasized that scribblers should always keep prior bars in mind. Then Cjfrankie shared insights into his journey by providing Gorga with assistance as a new scribbler!\n\n\nMeeting Agenda: Having ticked off the action items from the last meeting, the meeting officially started with a discussion on July’s points system. Kenichi says that the disbursement didn't happen last Tuesday because there were still many tasks left undone and we needed to clear that off. \n\n\nAgenda item number three features a discussion about September projections! Kenichi says that we might be a mile away from launching the long-anticipated podcast. He also hinted that the marketing guild and video workgroup will play a role in making the podcast come to life. Lastly, he mentioned that anyone interested can start a conversation in the writer's channel, plus we can also start a thread, too.\n\n\nFollowing that, we talked about the Q2 SNET ambassador programs’ monthly recap and the future recaps for substack; since the recaps are usually lengthy, Kenichi says that there's a need to split the recap into workgroups and guild updates separately. \n\n\nOnboarding: From a bird's-eye view, there is a massive surge of interest in the WWG. Kenichi pointed out that we have almost reached our KPI for Q3, and at the moment there are only three spots left for scribblers this quarter, so the onboarding window for Q3 2024 will be closed after we have onboarded five scribblers in Q3.\n\nFrom the Zealy side of things, Cjfrankie talks about spotting a user who has multiple accounts — Gorga, LordKizzy, and several other people present gave their opinions on how we can mitigate the issue. Kenichi added that we can't prevent users from having multiple accounts, and the best approach would be to do a check after the sprint. Whenever we cite multiple accounts by a user, we can check the proof of humanity by tracking how old their Twitter account is or by using the sprinter tag to track how old the account is, and finally, the reward will only go to one account. \n\n\nFollowing that, Devon shared updates from the video reviews on Zealy. As a matter of finality, LordKizzy suggested that we have a channel where we can discuss zealy-related topics.\n",

          "narrative": "The meeting commenced with Slate extending a warm welcome to all attendees. With everyone settled, Slate introduced an exciting new collaboration with Sophiaverse, where the focus would be on testing an advanced dialogue system within Roblox. The goal was to enhance NPC (non-player character) interactions using cutting-edge AI technology. Slate mentioned that a representative from Sophiaverse, Berick, would soon join the meeting to explain the details of the dialogue system.\n\nThe discussion then shifted to the pressing issue of the ongoing low AGIX token price, which was expected to impact the payment structure. After a brief deliberation, the group decided to halt payments for game preparation tasks and refrain from assigning new mentors. Additionally, payments for asset creation would be delayed until the AGIX token price stabilized.\n\nFollowing this, Lord Kizzy took the stage to present the completed video workgroup building. In his presentation, Lord Kizzy provided a comprehensive overview of the building. Upon entering the video workgroup, players are greeted by Killy, an NPC who welcomes new members and encourages them to have fun. Inside, players can find details about ongoing meetings, which are held every Friday at 16 UTC. Devon, another NPC, operates the display, while Malik and CryptoFly NPCs participate in the meeting, and Slate NPC is seen recording the session. Rojo NPC, as the workgroup lead, is seen facilitating the meetings. Players can interact with him through a proximity prompt to ask questions about joining the video workgroup. Rojo introduces himself and engages players in conversation, providing information on how to join the workgroup. Another NPC, representing Cardano Class, welcomes members and provides information about tasks for senior members, including roles like task manager, social media manager, and meeting facilitator. Judith NPC is seen documenting the session. Players can also visit the workstation area, where they are greeted by Lily Cupcake NPC. OEP NPC is busy working on a video, while in the Task Manager's Office, players meet Lord Kizzy's NPC, who is creating tasks for group members. The office also features a mini TV and refreshment center. In the Social Media Manager's Office, players can view YouTube awards and meet Osmium NPC, who is editing social media content. The presentation was well received by the members.(Watch the workgroup video via the link in the media section for better understanding.)\n\nSlate then showcased a new feature called the Rolling Camera for Workgroups. This feature automatically directs the camera to the required NPC when a player enters a workgroup building, enhancing the immersive experience.\n\nThe group then moved on to assigning the quarterly report task, which was given to Lord Kizzy.\n\nWith the formalities out of the way, the meeting transitioned into a gaming session, featuring the game \"Capture the Flag.\" During the game, Berick, the representative from Sophiaverse, joined the session. He encouraged the group to continue enjoying the game while he made preparations for his presentation on the dialogue system. The group had a great time playing the game.\n\nOnce the game concluded, Berick delivered his presentation on the advanced dialogue system. He introduced a system designed to enhance narrative-driven interactions in Roblox by integrating a Language Model (LLM) to role-play characters. This system generates automatic prompts based on contextual information, such as available dialogue options and scripted dialogue. It then sends these prompts to the LLM, which processes them and returns responses, allowing characters to engage in unique, dynamic conversations each time, rather than relying solely on pre-scripted dialogue.\n\nBerick highlighted several key features and functions of the system:\n\nDynamic Dialogue Generation: The system can take scripted lines (e.g., \"Welcome to the Gamers Guild. What would you like to know?\") and enhance them with additional context or flair, making each interaction slightly different and more engaging.\n\nContextual Awareness: The system integrates contextual data, like the state of the game or events (e.g., an enemy attacking), into the prompt, ensuring that the character’s responses are relevant to the current situation.\n\nResponse Handling: When a player asks a question (e.g., \"I want to make games like this\"), the system fetches the relevant scripted response, processes it through the LLM, and provides a personalized reply. The system is designed to guide conversations back to the game’s narrative if players go off-topic, ensuring a coherent and immersive experience.\n\nDialogue Tree Integration: While the system is primarily built around a dialogue tree structure, it can also incorporate other types of contextual data, such as ongoing or past discussions, allowing for intelligent off-topic chitchat while eventually steering the conversation back to the main narrative.\n\nCharacter-Specific Knowledge: Each character in the game can have its own data container, meaning that they are knowledgeable only about specific areas relevant to their role. For example, a treasury manager would refer players to someone else for onboarding information, maintaining a realistic and immersive character interaction.\n\nLooking ahead, Berick emphasized the importance of testing the system to identify and resolve potential issues, such as handling off-topic responses or preventing the LLM from generating irrelevant content. The ultimate goal is to create smarter, context-aware NPCs in Roblox that deliver more engaging and dynamic dialogues while adhering to the game’s narrative structure.\n\nSlate concluded the meeting by thanking all participants for their contributions. Overall, it was a productive and engaging session.\n",

Everyone to contribute to the Strategy Guild Working Document [OPEN]\n\n2. Everyone to contribute to the Possible Survey Questions [DONE]\n\n3. Core members should indicate interest in facilitating the new sheet in the working doc [OPEN]\n\n4. Effiom to share previous meeting summaries and this meeting summary [DONE]\n\n5. YemiSolves to document and share the Workshop Session [DONE]\n\n6. Onyeka to mentor Yemisolves [DONE]\n\n7. Adopt Last Meeting Notes [DONE]\n\n\nONBOARD NEW MEMBERS/CORE MEMBER ROLL CALL - 2 new people (i.e. Yedi and Martin Soki) have indicated an interest in becoming core members of the Strategy Guild since the last meeting, however, they haven’t met the requirements.\n\nAyo explained how everyone can become a member, and also contribute and be a part of what is happening within the guild.\n\n\nSTRATEGY GUILD CORE TAG (VERIFICATION AND ASSIGNING) - There is a need for verification of those who have met the requirements and are eligible for the Strategy Guild core member tag. \nCurrently, 5 people have met the requirement (i.e. Ayo, Gorga, Effiom, Tuso, and Lord Kizzy). Their other Gs and WGs tags need to be verified.\n\nAyo highlighted that this is meant to be an async process and should be managed by someone. Effiom was nominated to take up this role and he accepted.\nOther points raised during this discuss;\n* Should there be tags for intending members of the guild who are yet to meet all the requirements to become Core members?\n\n* Which of the requirements should be relaxed for this category?\n\n\nSTRATEGY GUILD Q3 RESEARCH - The document is closed, no more contributions. The next phase is discussions on the execution.\n\n\nTHE OUTBOUND WGs/Gs WORKSHOP SOLUTION SESSION PHASE ONE - The Workshop documenter will share the notes for this session. See reference to notes below:\n\n* Strategy Guild Workshop Day Two Solution Framework Session One docx\n\n* Summary Notes:  Strategy Guild Workshop Day Two Solution Framework Session One docx\n\n\nA.O.B - Ayo expressed gratitude to the participants and provided an overview of the plan for the next sessions\n",

Peter asked members if they were interested in facilitating the call but Onize suggested facilitating the next call.\n\n\n-Budget Deficiencies: Due to Devaluation of AGIX: \nSlate highlighted that the addition of the budget cuts (24.8%)  and the token price devaluation sums up to almost a 50% cut which is not feasible for workgroups to operate, there was a suggestion for some workgroups to shift to Bi-weekly sessions rather than weekly sessions but some members felt that the allocation for meeting facilitation and documentation is a small portion of their budget allocation and reducing meeting sessions doesn’t make significant changes. Peter indicated that there is a program wide reserves which was obtained from leftover budgets from workgroups and in the current system there is no sustainable way of maintaining the reserves if we are taking from it. Lordkizzy highlighted that Workgroups Quarterly report on deliverables will be hugely affected due to the budget deficiencies, Vanessa suggested that WGs should decide whether to prioritise keeping the WG running, or doing project-based work (and that decision will vary from WG to WG) she also suggested WGs could each select 1 item that they really want to do but can no longer afford, and ask for it to be funded from reserves.\n\n\n-Facilitating and documenting next 3 Town Halls after the 13th: \nPeter indicated that he won’t be available for the 3 Town Halls (20th, 27th, 3rd of next month). 3 members volunteered (Onize, Guillermo,, Clement),  peter highlighted that he would create a full open process by posting it on the Ambassadors general chat for everyone to volunteer and then we will decide from there\n",

We were aiming to come to agreement on fairness and accountability, and establish general principles on e.g. late work, illness, non-contribution, etc, and how to distribute rewards/payments in those situations. We acknowledged the need to be flexible and understanding, but also recognised the risk of people taking advantage of too much flexibility, especially around deadlines. We also recognised the importance of people communicating if they won't be able to meet a deadline; and the importance of establishing, at the start of a particular task, exactly how it will be assessed and paid.\n\nSome decisions were made, but further discussion is needed on some issues, so the group agreed to continue to discuss async in the shared doc \"Money questions\", and to try to reach agreement on outstanding issues at its next meeting.\n\nThe group then worked through the issues on the GitHub board.\n\nThere is still some disagreement on how the strategy-writing tasks (now in \"Done\" on the board) should be paid to fairly reflect people's contributions. It was agreed that the Admin team will step in to try to facilitate reaching agreement.\n\nDue to pressure of time in the meeting, we agreed that for the \"In progress\" tasks, people will update Issues that are assigned to them as needed, rather than going through the whole board in this meeting.\n\nWe looked at the \"To do\" task of interviewing people about their attitudes to AI ethics, and noted that members' proposed interviews add up to around $1,000 over budget. Despite posts in the WG Discord channel asking people to lower their totals, nobody has; so we agreed that the Admin team will amend the suggestions, and post a redraft in Discord for people to agree to or not.\nWe also agreed that training will take place in the first week of September, when everyone is likely to be back from holidays.\nWe also noted that we want to do further interviewing in Q4 2024, so we will include a budget line for interviews in Q4, and people can propose anything that was over budget for Q3 in the next quarter.\n\nWe noted that the \"AI conversations\" budget line we had in the Q3 budget has to be cut, to fit the budget to the current low AGIX price; but again, we will aim to include it as a budget element in Q4.\n",

This raises wider questions for us as a WG on what is fair re: money and pay, and is part of our governance as a WG. (Examples: what happens if someone cannot do a task for reasons beyond their control, such as illness? What if someone drops out of a task? Or if work is done late? What if there's a team, and one person does more work than the others - and how do we determine what is \"more work\" - is it about time, capability, or something else?) So we agreed to discuss in general terms in our next meeting.\n\nQuick discussion about reportbacks from WG to GEI meetings: Jenn is happy to just share her written reportback rather than actually talking to it in the GEI meeting.\n\nAGI-24: roles are all assigned, and Vani will share info on meeting links, more exact role descriptions, templates for documentwers, etc in the next few days. There will also be a training session with Esther for interviewers. Thanks to all who signed up.\n\nAI Ethics Conversations - not many people have signed up with an idea yet; and 2 of the suggested ideas are actually being covered at the AGI-24 pre-event instead. So requesting more ideas from members.\n\nConfirmed that the \"Creating learning resources\" budget line has been pushed to Q4, if at all - and noted that Education Guild is already doing some similar work this quarter; there may be scope for collaboration. Vani asked if WGs who are working on learning resources could add a note to the relevant issue on our board, so when we plan for Q4 we know what's been done and don't tread on toes.\n\nOn plans for Q3 interviewing: we discussed wide range of good ideas from members; but we're over budget so members are asked to cut down their totals to a max of $200. Confirmed that we want to interview a range of people, from AI professionals to people with no prior knowledge of AI; and importance of covering a range of demographics. Discussed idea of interviewing teenagers - there are additional ethics issues involved, but it should be possible. Also confirmed that we can do more interviewing in Q4.\n\n",

          "narrative": "We noted that the objections raised in round 1 of consent process to Marketing Guild’s budget have been resolved, so Marketing is now approved.\n\nObjections in Consent Round 1 to Writers’ WG were because their budget was not submitted in time. But it has now been updated, and there have been further objections in this consent round. The objections are shown in the budget calculator sheet; they include asking for:\n- detailed budget breakdown, including hours spent on tasks\n- clearer deliverables\n- tracking of past achievements, including more detail on outputs - e.g. number of posts, conversion rate to followers on social platforms, email signups\n- reasons for increased budget, plus the overall size of the increase (50% higher than Q1)\n\n1. and 2. The meeting accepted that there *is* a detailed budget breakdown and info on deliverables, including hourly rates; altho the link to it wasn’t obvious and had been missed by some people. (learning point for the group: make the link a bit more obvious next time.)\n\n3. Info on past achievements is in the group’s Q1 report. The meeting noted that Zealy’s free plan has limitations on analytics, but it can track number of participants and number of quests claimed, and these have been included in the Q1 report. On article views on Substack and Medium, the meeting noted the difference between views and actual reads: Kenichi said the number of reads was not in the report, but shared his screen to show read numbers - due to export limitations, detailed analytics are only shared during WG meetings. (Learning point:for all workgroups, try and include your achievements in your budget somehow.)\n\n4. The budget increase is for \n- mainly, the points system (which rewards various tasks and supports onboarding new scribes)\n- new social media (Twitter in Pidgin, French, and Spanish)\n- Zealy (supporting Zealy Sprints, which were previously biweekly but are now monthly at $450 per sprint, with rewards for top contributors and random participants). \nNo other items saw an increase.\n\nQuestions were raised on creation of additional Twitter accounts - is there collaboration with Translation workgroup, LatAm or African Guild, rather than expanding the budget? Kenichi said he plans to talk to Inés about Spanish translations, and engage native Spanish and French speakers for Twitter channels.\n\nThe meeting noted Video WG’s social media budget is lower; but Writers’ WG’s social media has wider responsibilities.\n\nDiscussion of centralised approach and distribution of responsibilities in WWG: the budget was not submitted in time because Kenichi was ill and nobody else could do it. Kenichi said there are efforts to improve: Scribe role can now manage tasks like budget submission.\n\nDiscussion of the points system: several people felt it is untransparent, and that it pushes the WG’s budget up. Kenichi acknowledged that it is untransparent, but assured that it is designed fairly; he also argued it improves engagement and scalability, with rewards scaling based on participation and a fixed budget cap.\n\nR&D Guild members raised concerns about governance consistency: similar issues re R&D’s budget have been handled differently from Writers’ issues. (Specifically, one R&D Guild project was accidentally omitted from R&D’s total budget; it was added before the deadline, but the total on the budget spreadsheet was accidentally not updated, so if people were looking at the total rather than at R&D’s budget, they might have been consenting to the wrong total - and the decision was made in a previous meeting to remove the late-added project from R&D’s budget). There was a suggestion that the Experiments pool could be used to address the extra R&D proposal.\n\n\n",

Everyone was of the opinion that we should migrate all the old tasks, too! For the sake of accountability. Sucre also added that the entire program hasn't fully recognized GitHub, therefore, the GitHub board will showcase the projects that were completed and marked as done. More so, the new tasks will still be created and assigned via Dework for the weekly payouts.\n\nAI Ethics EXPO: Clements sheds more light on the forthcoming in-person event in Nigeria. He mentioned that the African Guild and AI Ethics Alliance event will take place in September; however, the date of this event will be announced as we move further along! He also added that there would be streaming platforms available to enable community members to catch a glimpse of the event from the comfort of their homes.\n\nAs a matter of finality, Clement talked about the Q3 budget reduction and the price of AGIX; momentarily, he cited a discussion from a recent Treasury meeting where workgroups were asked to consider moving mi or tasks to Q4 whilst giving more hand to major projects within their workgroup.\n",

First off, our discussion was centered around the Q3 reports and what we're going to present in the Q3 report document. \n\nKenichi shared more insider tips on the MIX Post tool from the R&D guild! He highlighted how this tool will be beneficial to the WWG, especially for social media scheduling. He did mention that the R&D guild will take care of the maintenance and licensing for three months. After this period, the video WG and WWG will take full responsibility. Lastly, Kenichi added that the project is still in its infancy, so he'd develop a close connection with Rojo to stay in the loop so the WWG would get the most out of the tool.\n\nWe also talked about how the writer's workgroup could publish the monthly substack newsletter a bit sooner; in recent times, the WG has been faced with some potential delays. Kenichi proposed the idea of signposting scribblers to WGs and guilds, which they do not often attend, to capture actual facts about the meeting. He also added that he would create a column in the points system sheet to track these activities.\n\nFollowing that, Cjfrankie shared an update on his discussion with Sandra regarding the articles the scribblers wrote for Cogito a little while ago. Sanda did mention that she'd reach out to Kenichi afterward to discuss the payments. Momentarily, with screen sharing, Kenichi shed light on how the WG could tap into Cogito for more article deals. He proposed the idea of making Twitter threads 🧵.\n\nWe switched gears to discuss the conversation around the OpenGov call held on September 15th. Lady Tempestt sets the Thames on fire with conversations about digging into the WWG reserves. The discussion also featured talks around multisignature wallets and the WWG allocation status. \n\nWe had a discussion on the tests taken by the aspirants — Kenichi mentioned that the result sheets would be announced in the next meeting. \n\nFrom the Zealy side of things, Kenichi announced that July’s sprint will be ending in a few days; in light of this, he spoke about a 48-hour marathon, which involves adding quests on the board to enable the sprinters to boost their chances of topping the chart.\n",

Duke, Lady Tempestt, Yemi Solves, Lord Kizzy, Emmanuel, Ngala, Tert extended their greetings in their native languages.\n\nThe minute of the last meeting was agreed.\n\n\nAI Ethics EXPO: Duke mentioned that during the last AI Ethics WG meeting, we presented our update and to furthermore reach out to the prospective speaker we expect from them. He stated that we are to produce two speakers (OBO Obum, who is in the program and is an AI and blockchain expert and John Obidi, who is not in the program but however he is one of our partner’s for our deep funding proposals and he is the founder for head start Africa which is one of our industry partners for our deep funding proposal that have been funded). He also stated that we are expecting to have Leeloo and either Haley  or EstherG  from AI Ethics WG and both of them will be speaking respectively on AI ethics and AI governance. \n\nBudget Reduction for Q3: Due to the token merger and the drastic drop in AGIX, we need to reduce our budget. Duke proposed the idea of taking a break to save funds, while Kateri suggested updating our weekly meetings to a biweekly schedule. Lady Tempestt recommended pushing some items from this quarter to the next, and Lord Kizzy echoed Kateri's suggestion but proposed biweekly meetings only for this quarter. Duke initiated the WG budget discussion, but due to time constraints, he recommended scheduling another call focused entirely on budgeting.\n\nDo we need a core contribution role/tag? Duke clarified what a core contributor role/tag was, he explained that any person who would be a core contributor in the Guild will more naturally have a higher stake in the affairs of the African Guild. He went ahead and said it could be a core contributor role or just any other role within the Guild that we can use. Lady Tempestt said that we need to firstly describe the role in order for us to get the right tags for the role. Duke further clarified that he values people who are more active in terms of presence and contribution.\n\n\nDocumentation circle and operation: Clement presented the documentation roster and explained it. He further clarified that the names listed are not fixed and will be updated regularly. Several suggestions were made regarding the core team, review team, and documentation circle.\n",

We noted \n1) that we need to ensure Tevo is aware of the proposed dates;\n2) that we need to establish when the list of Core Contributors will be re-calculated, and what the dates for the \"opt-in\" process for being a Core Contributor will be.\n\nWe discussed the context-setting doc's section on valid reasons for objecting, and the idea of asking people not to \"nit-pick\" small details, but to focus on things that would actually do harm to the Program if they were agreed.\n\nWe discussed whether we should say that people who raise objections need to be present at the relevant discussion meetings or not\n\nWe discussed how we will keep core contributors engaged and informed through the whole consent process, by sharing short memos that cover which concerns have been addressed so far and which are still outstanding.\n\nWe discussed the wording for Guillermo's two infographics: 1) reminding WGs to submit their budgets by 9th Sept and 2) encouraging Core Contributors to take part in the consent process; and agreed that Guillermo and Vani will make final tweaks to the wording as soon as possible\n\nWe noted that when the consent process opens, Peter has already said he will contact Core Contributors via DM to encourage them to take part.\n\nWe discussed at leangth what should happen if a WG does not submit their budget in time. We recognised that late submission should be strongly discouraged because it holds the whole process up. In previous Quarters, it has been suggested that a WG that does not submit a budget should have to work on their previous quarter's budget - but this time, this would not be workable since the token price is so much lower than it was for Q3, so most WGs' Q3 budgets would be more than we could afford. There has been a suggestion in the past that a WG who submits late should get no budget - but this is not a good idea, especially not for WGs that are \"core\" to the Program. So we agreed on late submitters getting a minimal budget, the exact amount to be determined by referencing their previous Quarters' budgets and the token price at the time. \n\nWe agreed this idea needs to go out to all WG leads - who are all core contributors, so it could be done via the Core Contributor tag - to check they agree with it.\n",

Everyone to contribute to the Strategy Guild Working Document [OPEN]\n\n2. Core members should indicate interest in facilitating the new sheet in the working doc [OPEN]\n\n3. Effiom to share previous meeting summaries and this meeting summary [DONE]\n\n4. YemiSolves to document and share the Workshop Session [DONE]\n\n5. Adopt Last Meeting Notes - 12.08.2024 [DONE]\n\n6. Yemi Solves to create and share a sheet for Gs/WGs rep to add other contributions to aid with the report and analysis of the workshop [DONE]\n\n\nONBOARD NEW MEMBERS/CORE MEMBER ROLL CALL - Two intending members (Photogee and Cjfrankie) were encouraged to keep attending meetings as they have met all but one of the requirements to become Core Members of the Strategy Guild\n\nAyo highlighted the importance of active involvement in the Strategy Guild and that people can still show interest in facilitating the working document.\n\n\nTHE OUTBOUND WGs/Gs WORKSHOP SOLUTION ADOPTION SESSION - The session focused on discussing how these solutions could be best deployed and adopted by the different WGs, with various representatives providing insights and perspectives on the proposed strategies.\n\nHighlights and takeaways from the Solution Adoption Session\n\n1. In-WG/G Solutions Discussion: Gs/WGs representatives were advised to take a few minutes to share the solutions from the workshop at their respective meetings. Also, Adoption should be easier, hence the reason for proper representation of WGs during the 4 days of the workshop\n\n2. Solutions for improving Social media engagement and visibility: In a bid to speed up the Substack publication, Writers WG decided to assign Scribblers to various Gs/WGs meetings within the program.\n* Premium tool subscription and the importance of keyword research drawing insights from the “AI Cryptography” article by Mikasa. \n* The social media mixed post automation solution which is in the testing phase at R&D Guilid will be utilized by Video and Writers WG.\n* Content Calendar optimization based on the algorithm suggestions on the best time for social media post.\n\n3. Solutions roles/tasks and budgeting: Gs/WGs would decide on this and the Strategy Guild would follow up on the feedback.\n\n4. Solutions Feedback System for the Strategy Guild: Feedback Template and Form (Open/Monthly/Quarterly), and Tracking Sheet.\n\n5. Solutions Audit and Improvement Process/Plan for the Strategy Guild\n\n6. Gs/WGs have autonomy on whether to adopt these solutions. However, a feedback system would be created to assess the impact of the workshop\n\n\nA.O.B - Ayo expressed gratitude to the participants and provided an overview of the plan for the next sessions",

He also noticed that a new test had been submitted and asked other Scribes to review it. Kenichi recommends that the three participants who have taken the test should retake it. He will send this information to the reviewers (scribes) so they can contact the participants.\n\n2) Zealy board\nKenichi added video workgroup quests to the Zealy board, and discussed the backlog of older quests.\n\nKenichi has created a channel for Zealy reviewers and the channel is up and running\n\nSeveral assignments are awaiting review from Devon, who responded that he will review them today. Apart from that, Kenichi explained that now Zealy tasks carry out this process on a weekly basis, meaning that every weekend there are new tasks that will be done or released for review. Devon will send more quests on the Zealy board today.\n\nRegarding the old quest backlog, Kenichi let some tasks from the previous sprint remain intending to maintain a balance between old participants and new. The main goal is to engage newcomers, so he wants to ensure that frequent participants don't always have an edge over new participants.\n\n4) Q3 Report and Q4 Budget\nOn the Q3 report: Kenichi reported that there are now more than 220 Medium subscribers; the aim is more than 300 before the end of the quarter. If we achieve this target, it will exceed WWG members' own expectations for this quarter. WWG members have two months left to reach that goal.\nKenichi admitted that content publication was a little slow, which is understandable because WWG's budget was only approved at the end of July. However, it is currently trying to catch up, and in August, there will be a lot of content published.\nRegarding Twitter/X followers, Kenichi reports that the SNET Ambassador Twitter has more than 1,200 followers, and continues to grow.\nOn onboarding, WWG has successfully onboarded two new writers and plans to add several more before the end of the quarter. Kenichi also mentioned that the group needs to discuss whether to open the onboarding process for the fourth quarter (Q4) or not.\n\n5) Governance calls\nAttendance at Governance calls, and the importance of representation in Town Halls, were emphasized, alongside updates on the Cogito collaboration project.\n\n6) Points system\nWe agreed to do a delegation process, where scribblers will signpost other scribblers to attend the point system distribution calls with Kenichi and a scribe, to get a glimpse of how the rewards are distributed every month.\n",

We agreed therefore to add this as a role in the Q4 budget.\n\nVani noted that in future, where it's useful to do so, we can distribute the WG's connection with the GEI - it shouldn't necessarily only be via the co-chair role. (For example, Duke wll be in touch with Esther and LeeLoo as speakers for the AI Ethics Expo in Nigeria).\n\nVani noted the usefulness and importance of the \"async work support\" role, given the kind of work we are doing.\n\nWe noted that we still don't know the cost of Clement's Q3 role of moderating the AI Ethics forum https://github.com/SingularityNet-Ambassador-Program/AI-Ethics-Workgroup/issues/32 - Clement will suggest a price based on how the Moderator WG costs things. He will also add the same amount to the budget for Q4.\n\nWe will create individual GitHub Issues for people's work at AGI-24, as it now looks as if the Foundation will be able to pay the work via the normal Ambassador process.\n\nThe Admin team has looked at the interviewing projects that people proposed for Q3, and have brought them within budget; so these will go ahead, ideally by the end of Q3 (although if it goes a little over, that is OK). We note that we have a really good range of people being interviewed. Any interviews that had to be cut can be re-proposed in Q4, as there will be more budget for interviews then. \n\nThe training for interview skills will now be 1 session not 2, and will be run by Vani and Peegee. Date: Wednesday, September 11th, 12:00 UTC, lasting 2 hours. It will be recorded for anyone who cannot make it, but Peegee explained how we'd like people to attend live if they can, as it will be participatory. It's open to all - but especially we'd like those who are doing Q3 interviewing to attend.\n\n\nTo Do:\nWe discussed reallocating the Q3 budget line for further work on the Strategies, because it has turned out that all the work that's needed can be covered by Vani's role as co-chair, and by Esther's input.\n\nThe AI Ethics Expo event in Nigeria (collab with African Guild) has a date: Sat 28th September. The planning element of our budget contribution has been done (venue and publicity) and the other elements (speakers and volunteers) will be paid after the event. Duke is liaising directly with LeeLoo and Esther as speakers from the GEI side.  \n\nVasu suggested that he could do some Q4 interviewing at an AI event in Dubai on 11th and 12th December, which he will be attending. Vani encouraged him to note it in the WG's Q4 interview planning spreadsheet (in the \"AI Ethics Stuff!\" doc).\n\nQ4 budget:\n - We discussed reducing meeting frequency to monthly, but there was significant enough oppositon to decide against it.\n\n- We discussed the budget line for Jenn's reportbacks to GEI - are they useful? Does GEI want them? We discussed this, but did not reach a conclusion. LeeLoo suggested that we might need the reports more once interviewing is in progress; possibly they are also good for transparency.\n\n- We agreed on budgeting for 40 interview hours this Quarter; conducting a small amount of work to share the GEI survey; and creating some educational resources.\n\n- We noted that comments and revisions to the budget need to be made by Fri 6th Sept, to allow for final editing before the submission deadline on September 9th.

            "Slate outlined the meeting agenda",
            "Slate started the meeting by demonstrating the use of a plugin called Scene Tools on Roblox. He highlighted how this plugin could be used to create spinning objects for decoration. By showing how a part could be made to rotate upon its axis, Slate emphasized the ease of using Scene Tools to make workgroups in Roblox appear more dynamic. He further demonstrated how to add an image (such as an NFT) to the part and how to scale and position the image label. However, Slate encountered a minor issue when using GIFs, which the plugin couldn’t load properly. He showed how the part, when decorated with infographics and light rays, could create an eye-catching element in a virtual workspace.",
            "Rebel shared his work on the building model of the Dework PBL Workgroup. He had made changes from the previous iteration, including adding a second floor and designing various functional spaces such as an entrance, meeting room, and classroom. Rebel highlighted the use of teleporters for navigation between floors, using a proximity prompt for interaction. He also demonstrated the design of a computer lab, aquarium, and other virtual elements. There was a brief discussion about an overlay message on the screen that needed to be removed, but overall, Rebel received positive feedback for his design.",
            "Malik presented his model of the Educational Guild workgroup. Malik explained the various sections he had built, including an entry section with an NPC to welcome users, a meeting schedule board, and a digital twin representation based on the Twin Protocol. He also created an ideation room, initially meant for an AI project, but later adjusted to serve as a space for brainstorming and initiatives like the AI for Beginners project. Malik had also included infographics, but ran into some challenges with implementing rotating elements, for which Slate had offered earlier assistance. The Education Guild Building got finalized.",
            "Scarecrow showcased his Treasury Guild model, which was designed to resemble a bank, fitting the theme of treasury management. He walked through the design of a parking lot, meeting areas, a cash counter, and a security vault. Scarecrow used NPCs to represent key members of the guild, with each NPC placed strategically in the model to depict the work they do within the guild. He also discussed future plans for expanding the model, possibly to the second floor.",
            "Lord Kizzy provided input regarding the Treasury Guild workgroup, discussing the structure of two sub-workgroups: Treasury Automation and Treasury Policy. He suggested these could be housed on different floors, but was unsure about the logistics due to the lack of documentation and the newness of the groups. He explained that while the Treasury Automation group was a temporary project, the Treasury Policy group would likely be more permanent. This led to a discussion on how best to accommodate these within Scarecrow’s existing model.",
            "Colleen joined towards the end of the meeting and provided an update on the R&D Guild workgroup. She mentioned that she had not been able to get a response from her partner OEP, but was willing to continue development. Slate suggested that Gorga(their mentor) could assist Colleen in moving the project forward.",
            "Slate demonstrated another useful plugin called Archimedes. This plugin is used to create circular arrangements of parts, which is typically difficult to achieve in Roblox. Slate walked through how to spawn parts and use the plugin to form perfect circles, which could be useful in a variety of design contexts. He also mentioned another plugin, 3D Text, which could be used to create 3D labels for workgroups, adding a professional touch to virtual environments",
            "Slate introduced the design of the VR map for the game, featuring three layers: a city, a river with a bridge, and Ambassador University. Players start in the city, where they earn AGIX currency by completing tasks, before moving to the university to finish quests and gain admission. The map development will utilize six baseplates and will require two best modelers to assist Slate with development of the city, river, and university sections. Players can explore all areas freely, but passes can be bought for faster progression. Slate also mentioned the potential to create portals linking different games or spin-off projects after players complete the Ambassador program."

To resolve this, he proposed forming a small team with a two-week deadline to ensure the framework's timely completion. He explained that this document is critical for the African Guild's mission to democratize AI in Africa, serving as a blueprint for organizing initiatives and ensuring the guild's efforts are aligned with its long-term goals.\n\nNebula, a new member, introduced himself and expressed a need for guidance on AI and SingularityNet. Duke welcomed him and suggested he work with Ayo on the Initiative and Contribution Framework document, highlighting the importance of mentorship for new members. \n\nClement updated the group on ongoing discussions about merchandise with the African Leadership University, and the importance of community input on research documents. Ayo proposed forming a team with Yemi and Nebula to work together on research and documentation, ensuring that new members are integrated and contributing effectively to the guild’s activities.\n\nDuke Peter proposed the creation of a document review circle to ensure that the guild's documents are thoroughly reviewed before submission to the ambassador program. This team would consist of qualified members who would work with document creators to make necessary modifications, thus maintaining high standards. Additionally, he raised concerns about the potential use of the guild's documents outside the SingularityNet ecosystem, with Ese Williams advising against such usage due to sensitive information and copyright issues. Duke suggested that the guild might consider a Creative Commons license and proposed the creation of a GitHub repository to solidify the African Guild’s work and ensure proper credit is given.\n\nAI Ethics Expo update: Duke provided updates on the planning for the SNET African Guild and AI Ethics Expo, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate location in Nigeria, with Lagos and Abuja as potential options. The event will involve a team handling content curation, documentation, media, and event evaluation, with virtual participation from key figures in the GEI (Global AI Ethics Initiative).\n\nQ3 Budget update: Duke Peter announced a reduction in the Q3 budget by $2,000 to meet quarterly requirements, affecting areas such as facilitation, meeting summaries, and AMA sessions. The budget now stands at $6,680 USD. Despite these cuts, Duke encouraged members to continue proposing initiatives and projects through the Members Collective document, emphasizing that funding is still available for initiatives that contribute to the guild’s growth.\n\nAfrican Guild Survey and Soulbound Token Project: Kenichi introduced a survey related to the African Guild’s responsibilities, offering incentives for participation, including early access to a new website and involvement in a loyalty system. The project involves creating a website for the ambassador program featuring a Soulbound token, a non-transferable NFT used for claiming badges and building a reputation system.\n\nAOB:\nTag for Members: A tag for African Guild members will be created to better identify and engage contributors in the region.\n",

The first topic we discussed was hovering around the Q4 budget proposal and the consent result. From the result, it is clear that 8 people have a yes consent, 6 people abstained from the proposal, and 9 people objected. In light of such, Kenichi did mention that he was going to tweak the draft, and we should expect to see the updated version. Kenichi also pointed out that there won’t be any form of SEO training in Q4, however, if anyone wants to do it, they’d be allocated a time, but there’s no budget allocation for the training!\n\nFollowing that, we switched gears and we talked about the current Zealy Sprint. Gorga suggested that we have some one-off tasks just so sprinters won’t have to complain about new members topping the chart. Kenichi also mentioned that he was going to delete some quotes from the board to make it organized. He also called the attention of the Scribes, telling them to pay more attention to the board. Merryman also suggested that quest reviews should be automated just so the review process becomes less stressful and time-consuming. Kenichi cleared the air by saying that some tasks are automated already, but some quests still need to be reviewed by the Scribes.\n\nFrom the publication side of things, he urged the Scribes to reach out to anyone who has drafts and have them upload them to the community page while they pay close attention to the editing framework.\n",

We used to, but now do not. Main points raised:\n- Could Video WG's summaries of TH include listing who is present? \n- Can we use a Dework template for it? We used to do so - but around Town Hall #49 the template was changed\n- How do we handle it if anyone present at TH does not have a Dework account?  Can we ask them async to create one, and thus support the onboarding process?\n- It is best to have one person responsible for capturing TH attendees via Read.ai, Zoom signups, etc - ideally someone who knows the community and will recognise people's Discord names\n- Should we try to catch up on the THs where we did not capture attendance? It would be a lot of manual work. Or should we just say that we used to do it, it was a useful experiment and we learnt from it, and look now at how we can improve the process so we can start afresh?",

'Building Cross-Chain AI Agents with Fetch.ai and Solana'\n\nThis hackathon aims to challenge participants to leverage Fetch.ai agent tech and Solana’s blockchain to build applications that automate complex workflows and interactions in decentralized systems. We have outlined three levels of problem complexity—easy, medium, and complex—each presenting its own challenge.\n\n\nIn this follow-up meeting, the SNET_LatAm Ambassadors team met with the Strategic Alliances team to finalize the operational strategy for introduction WorkShop for the ASI -fetch.ai- solana-hackathon, which will take effect on Tuesday, October 1st. \n\nThe LatAm team will provide support through communication channels and human resources to assist the Fetch technical team. Their responsibilities will include moderating discussions, serving as intermediaries for participants in Spanish and Portuguese, clarifying questions, and facilitating the exchange of ideas during the virtual Copa America Hackathon.\n\nIt was agreed during the meeting that the LatAm team would help with the introduction in Portuguese in charge of Andre and Daniela, supporting Rob and Sergey, who will handle the introductions in English and Spanish. Following the introduction, the team will participate in the first workshop of the event.\n\nAdditionally, the LatAm team will document each intervention and action, establish a methodology for tracking action items, and create a form to collect participant inquiries, which will help streamline a funnel of questions and answers.\n\nThe amount to be given to the winners will be established and shared by Rob to the ASAP team in order to incorporate it into the communication and the call to action.\n\nAt 18:00 UTC RoOb shared a text with the opening remarks for the Workshop. <<Link on top>>\n\nThe tentative schedule for Tuesday, October 1st, is as follows:\n\n10:00 AM BRT (UTC-3:00): Opening remarks with Sana Wajid and Alex Blagirev\n10:30 AM BRT (UTC-3:00): \"Built on Fetch.ai\" session with Abhi\n11:00 AM BRT (UTC-3:00): AI Agents Workshop with Abhi\nThe remaining event schedule can be accessed via the hackpack: Hackathon Hackpack.",

A vault, guarded by security personnel, was also included, along with a newly added treasury meeting room. Suggestions were made for improvements, indicating that many additional elements could enhance the building.",

Items DONE were closed and others were left OPEN:\n\n1. Continue contribution to the Guild’s working document [OPEN]\n\n2. Gorga to create a poll in Discord for other people to vote on the preferred meeting schedule for the guild [DONE]\n\n3. Effiom to draft and share last meeting summary [DONE]\n\n4. Yemi to follow up with other Gs/WGs representatives who are yet to fill out the form [DONE]\n\n5. Continue working on the Strategy Guild Q3 Report and Q4 Budget proposal async [DONE]\n\n6. Adopt Last Meeting Notes - 02.09.2024 [DONE]\n\n\n\nONBOARD NEW MEMBERS/CORE MEMBER ROLL CALL - Since the last meeting, Photogee met all the core membership requirements but no new person indicated interest in the document.\n\nAyo advised those who have indicated interest in becoming members of the Guild but are yet to meet all the requirements, to ensure to update their records as they meet the pending requirements.\n\n\n\nGORGA ALLEGATIONS ON PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE GUILD - Gorga highlighted his concerns which were mostly about the Q4 budget:\n* The Q4 budget doesn’t completely explain how tasks would be carried out\n\n* Q3 wasn’t transparent sighting the example of the availability of the meeting notes which were meant to be made available in Discord before the meeting but are only shared in the meetings\n\n* Hopes that in Q4 other members will get to prepare meeting agendas, facilitate meetings, and also create meeting notes\n\nAyo responded to these claims sighting that:\n\n* The Guild restarted its operations in Q3, and just like other Guilds in which Gorga is a member, he got to contribute in the following quarter and not the first quarter he joined\n\n* Members who were contributing majorly were those that understood the Q3 budget and were present during the approval process, hence it was easier for them to take part in the activities this quarter\n\n* He stated that members were asked to indicate facilitation interest in the working doc, and a roster was being worked on ahead of Q4 using that list\n\n* Gorga contributed to the research and was rewarded as a representative of the WWG during the Q3 workshop\n\n\n\nTHE DRAFTED Q3 REPORT AND Q4 BUDGET DISCUSSIONS - The Guild’s meeting has been updated to capture the new Bi-weekly schedule. The workshop initiative will continue based on the success of the Q3 workshop. \n\n\nA.O.B - Ayo expressed gratitude to the participants and provided an overview of the plan for the next sessions.",

We noted their GitBook https://docs.oceanprotocol.com, and we noted that the X space raised interesting questions on how each Ambassador program approaches the issue of how to attract and retain capable people, especially given that an Ambassador Program usually cannot pay \"market rates\". Peter also raised the issue  - at the X space itself, and in this meeting - that the sNET Ambassador Program is a bit different from the average, and that he likes the fact that we have a focus on building decentralised community, not just creating content. This meeting generally agreed with this.\n\n2) We looked at the Tasks sheet for Governance WG and set action items on how to progress it (see \"Action Items\" below)\n\n3) We agreed that at the next Open Gov meeting on 10th Oct, Onboarding WG will share their work on \"Onboarding Journeys\".\n\n4) We noted that next Tuesday (8th Oct)'s Gov WG session will be a retrospective on the entire \"consent decisionmaking\" experiment over the last several Quarters, and a small group (Peter, Vani, Guillermo, Love, Onize) will meet on Mon 7th to plan the session. It might lead to further discussion on the agenda item \"Should we consider trying a different decision-making process, or continue to explore Consent decision making? How and where will we further discuss possible changes to the process?\"\n\n5) We  re-discussed the ongoing agenda issue of \"Increasing numbers vs, non-increasing Program budget\". We noted that this issue also came up in Onboarding WG earlier today; several WGs are closed or closing, so what are we onboarding people to? We discussed whether there should be some kind of cap on numbers in the program overall - the main thoughts were:\n - If there's a cap on total numbers, how many? (Suggestion:around 60? We currently have 54-ish Core Contributors, and things are beginning to feel \"full\")\n - If we have a cap, we would need to be clearer about how people come in, and what the \"front door\" actually is. The \"front door\" in a sense may be the extant process for becoming a Core Contributor - but where are people coming in to that process from? There was a suggestion that many people are invited by a friend.\n - Should people join the Program by invitation, after they have been attending meetings for a while, and if they talk sense and seem committed? (This obviously raises the question of who \"invites\" them and who decides. Also, are they \"invited\" to be a Core Contributor, thereby removing the existing process of automatically becomeing a Core Contributor based on one's activities; or are they simply invited to join the Program at all, and work towards becoming a Core Contributor?)\n - Should we have a set date in the quarter when we accept new people; and otherwise, the official line is \"We're closed\"?\n - Should any caps on numbers not be across the Program as a whole, but decided WG-by-WG? (i.e. a WG can decide to close, but other WGs might remain open to new people)\n- If a WG is closed, this would probably mean that new people can still attend meetings and engage in discussion/share their opinions, but not officially join the WG or take paid tasks.\n\n6) We noted that Core Contributors would need to make the decision about whether to bring in a cap on numbers. We noted that many people are feeling exhausted after the lengthy Q4 budget decision process, so it would probably be best not to start a decision process on a numbers cap immediately, but to allow a couple of weeks for people to \"recover\". We also noted that the decision would not necessarily need to be made using consent decision-making; another methodology could be selected.\n\n7) We noted that for many decision-making processes (including consent decision-making), there needs to be a proposal to discuss, vote on, consent to, etc. We also noted a potential difficulty: any proposal on this issue would probably have multiple elements, and people might agree with one, and not another; so a proposal would need to be broken down into its different elements and agreement would need to be reached on each part.\n\n8) We noted that the consent decision-making process currently in use was intended as an experiment; that there is discussion in progress on whether to continue with it, or try a different methodology; and that in the Governance WG session on Tuesday 8th Oct there will be a retrospective session on how the consent methodology has gone overall. We mentioned several other possible processes, including consensus, and advisory (a small group researches and makes recommendations).  There was some supporrt for trying both of these, as well as support for the modified \"consent process\" with an 8-% threshold which has been used for the Q4 budget decision..\n\n8) In the light of the above, we decided  (see \"decisions\" below) to create a small, temporary focus group to further discuss the issue of a cap on numbers, and to come up with a proposal that could be used in a consent process on the issue if it is decided that consent is the methodology that should be used. This use of a focus group is, in effect, the beginnings of including an \"advisory\" element in our decisionmaking. The focus group will bring their findings, and a suggested proposal on which Core Contributors could be asked for consent, to the Governance WG meeting on Tues 15th Oct.\n\n",

All these tasks were moved to “Done” and made ready for payment.\n\n-Event in Nigeria: Duke says the event was excellent while giving us a recap! There is a written report here Report for the \"Ubuntu and AI\" EventConference with quantitative and qualitative data(e.g. how many people showed up virtually and in person at the event, topics of discussion, and the rest) on how everything went. We also discussed how to sort out payment for speakers where Duke said that he paid one speaker up front so Ubio will get payment, while Esther and Leeloo's payments will go to the volunteers of the event; they both confirmed this. This task was moved to ”Done” and ready for payment this week.\nModeration of the AI Ethics forum: There is no agreement on this yet. Will be done later today.\nDocumenting GEI Open Office: We are yet to hear from Jenn concerning these documents.\n\nWe went onto tasks in “to-do”;\n\n-Q3 Interviews: Clement has done a few interviews. Colleen will get to do them this week. Ayo said he has started today and Ese said she will get started this week and give an update later on GitHub. They were all reminded to move their individual tasks to “in progress” and put down comments or updates as soon as possible.\n\n-Q4 Budget: The Budget passed but we decided to work on budget fitting, currently it's around 21.68% or so(it should be less after WWG adjusted budget and current AGIX price). We checked a few items that we might need to reduce or cut down due to budget fitting which included interview hours and expenses(Ayo said he would have a few interview expenses), meetings, survey, and educational resources. There are a few other items we might consider cutting if necessary and possible.\n",

            "Rojo provided updates on our social media role: the usual schedule is being followed that is short videos are posted every Tuesday and Saturday at 11:00 UTC, while long videos are shared on Monday or Friday at 17:00 UTC. He confirmed that all videos from last month have been uploaded. Rojo also hosted an X space with the Ocean Protocol ambassador program, which received positive feedback. He is currently fine-tuning the automation tool, which is experiencing backend issues with long video posts being done manually. Rojo acknowledged that he forgot to grant senior members access to the automation tool; senior members should ask him for a login. Additionally, he is engaging with commenters. He mentioned that he is manually posting on Instagram due to API issues, as Meta isn't providing access.",
            "Rojo mentioned that he is developing a feature called \"mix post\" for the automation tool, which allows creators to post directly without sharing a drive link. Kizzy inquired how voting for videos would work, to which Rojo explained that users can comment on the video on mix post before it is uploaded to social platforms. He also noted that he is encountering some issues with this feature, which he hopes to resolve soon.",
            "Devon provided updates on Zealy, noting that he asked Kenichi about the next sprint. Kenichi replied that it won't be happening soon and that Zealy is now under the marketing guild, rather than the video or writers workgroup.",
            "Kizzy explained on Zealy that its structure is changing, with the next sprint focusing on outreach rather than videos and articles, as having two Zealys within one community indicates a lack of communication. They will experiment with a tiered structure and compare its effectiveness to the previous approach. Rojo noted that while Zealy is improving metrics, it serves more for itself than for the video workgroup. He suggested hosting live streams, like X spaces, to increase participation, potentially featuring a meme or video creation competition with rewards for the top three using the Zealy platform. Kizzy affirmed that this new Zealy approach aims to achieve similar goals.",
            "Rojo suggested that, since Zealy is ending, we should allocate those funds to live X spaces and giveaways for meme or video competitions. Kizzy countered that we still owe $225 to Writer WG, and that the previous sprint should be covered by the video workgroup. The remaining budget could then help offset cuts instead of being used for giveaways and X spaces.",
            "With task manager not present, Slate went through all the pending tasks on the dework board. Rojo stated that he created the August monthly updates video and contacted the task manager to set up a task for it, but after two days, he hadn't seen a response. He suggested having a backup in case he is unavailable. Kizzy agreed to create a task for it, emphasizing that urgent videos can't be delayed.",
            "Devon mentioned that the new videos feature unique intros and asked if we should use a single unified intro for all videos. Rojo suggested that we can maintain consistency in color and textures, the animations can differ.",
            "Lilycupcake inquired about the criteria for posting shorts. Kizzy explained that they simply create a short and request the task manager to create a task for it. Kizzy also proposed a budget of $20 for clips and $30 for shorts created from scratch, which everyone agreed on. The discussion then shifted to the process for creating short clips, specifically whether there should be an open task for direct submissions or if there should be a vote on clip topics before creating them. Slate will create a poll in the channel for this purpose.",
            "Kizzy presented the budget, noting a 17.47% overall cut, amounting to $1,651. To accommodate this, a 10% reduction was applied to every recurring task except quality control, with the remainder covered by the Zealy and contingency budgets. We then discussed how much to reduce the budget for the social media role. Members noted that we lack sufficient data to assess the impact of the new automation tool, and only after evaluating its effectiveness can we make a decision. Additionally, the allocation for social media isn't fixed; it's likely to be less utilized than originally planned, allowing savings to be redirected to other tasks.",

A couple of minutes later, Kenichi arrived and joined the conversation. Facilitated by CJ Frankie, We started by checking the action items from the last meeting, link here Writers Workgroup Meeting: 23rd August 2024.\n\nAfter CJ Frankie, Lady Tempestt, and Inés Gaviña commented on the importance of creating a team-based Q3 budget and improving our proposal submission for next quarter, Kenichi shared the Q3 budget draft in the Writers WG Discord channel, link here WWG Q3 Report: DRAFT: WWG Q3 Report.\n\nKenichi highlighted that the whole Ambassadors Program was dealing with budget constraints due to the token depreciation and stated that we wouldn’t be able to add much to it. He also shared that the proposal was still incomplete and in a draft state and that every WG member could comment and share their insights and ideas for next quarter's proposal budget.   \n\nLady Tempestt insisted on the importance of sharing the budget-writing process as Kenichi cannot have eyes on everything and how he could share numbers and metrics so that different WG members could help him write reports. On the other hand, Kenichi expressed the impossibility of sharing certain ambassadors' accounts with everybody and that writing the budget proposal requires technical information that can only be found on the Ambassador’s Zealy and Substack. \n\nLady Tempestt shared her interest in hosting the SEO Workshop and stated that we wouldn’t need too much budget to do it, with 100 or 200 USD would be enough. Kenichi believed that as we were a writers group we should be focusing on writing and discussing topics and subjects. Kenichi suggested that maybe the Marketing Guild was interested in hosting such a Workshop, although he warned about how the Marketing Guild is still starting to organize itself and is not able to amplify our articles yet. \n\nLady Tempestt also shared her concern on how we are not publishing How-to articles,  Kenichi answered that the WG was always flexible and open to new ideas as with Gaviña’s We Are Reading series. Kenichi suggested Lady Tempestt bring her ideas into the Discord and share them with the WG.\n \nKenichi also shared his concern regarding the New Zealy Sprint and his reflections and ideas on how to avoid the continuous bot intervention. He said that the backbone of the Zealy Quest is to onboard new members to the Ambassador Program and with the multiplication of fake accounts and members joining again and again the dynamic is not working. He shared the idea of reducing the points in each quest and reducing the points on the onboarding task to avoid bots and fake accounts. Inés Gaviña asked Kenichi if the LATAM Guild could share quests with the Global Zealy Sprint and Kenichi said that would be a fantastic idea. \n\nKenichi commented he found some inconsistencies within the reviews of the Writers WG Tests, he felt that sometimes reviewers are afraid to put low numbers in the test and he suggested we shouldn't be afraid to put low numbers on tests that are not up to the level of the Ambassadors Program. \n\n\nUpdates:\nAlthough still facing low engagement, the Spanish and French X accounts are finally activating themselves and starting to create content. \n\nFeedback on Eric Davies not approved test, writers shared with him the importance of proper research and thorough reading of the test objectives\n",

Although there is a significant decrease, WG members (Lady Tempestt and Devon) shared their concerns and thoughts on some of the deliverables. The meeting featured a discussion on Gorga’s initiative, which aims to expand the reach of SingularityNET in Indonesia through X (formerly Twitter). Many were of the opinion that we should implement the idea in Q1 2025 given the fact that AGIX is dropping and with a concern about the Q4 allocation not being able to sustain the WG. Following that, Lady Tempestt suggested that Kenichi give Gorga a KPI tracking matrix for the proposed initiative. More so, Ines supported Gorga’s idea, and she suggested that the French page could be suspended to give Gorga a chance. As a matter of finality, Kenichi added that the French page could still be functional regardless; he also said that we could still go forward with the Indonesian page as it might just perform better than we expected.\n\nKenichi also talked about the “We Are Reading Series” by Ines. He expresses his love for the previously published series. He added that he’d glance through Ines’s latest submission while having Makasa make a thread for it.\n",

Especially since we already agreed on the budget, $30 for 6 people each, but we have set no target for this task yet. \n- The survey to gather data from people about their concerns on AI ethics and their thoughts on it, we discussed this for a bit on how it should be distributed. \n- 6 people indicated interest in survey sharing: PG, Kenichi, Valola, Clement, Onize and Ashley\n- A suggestion was made for sharing in focus groups on social media like Reddit, another ideated sharing at a conference. \n \n",

          "narrative": "Discussion Points:\nDuke initiated the meeting by sharing his thoughts on decentralization and its contrast with his country's oligarchy system. \n\nRecap of the initiative’s aims and the role of the AI Ethics WG\nEsther began by giving a recap of the BEGIN (Beneficial General Intelligence Nexus for EthicalAI), she mentioned the initiative started cause there’s hardly any voicing out of views on the ethics surrounding AI.  \nShe discussed the aim of gathering human values on safety and ethics and providing ways for people to contribute resources towards safe and ethical AI.\nIt has two phases: the creation of an AI chatbot and knowledge graphing and a DAO resource-sharing system, which simply means people contribute resources to the ecosystem and carefully distribute or set up systems to distribute the resources fairly. \n\nAt present, we are in phase 0 of manual data collection. This is a crucial role of the AI Ethics Working Group (WG) within BeGIN. The collected data will serve as the foundation for constructing an information structure for the knowledge graph and subsequently developing the chatbot. This process will lay the groundwork for the knowledge graph that will power the chatbot. \n\nEsther also spoke of the need for magic wand questions: \"What kind of AI tools would you want to develop if you had unlimited money\" This can create data for how people want to see AI and its resources used. She also speaks of us needing to prioritise highly diverse data so not just SNET ambassadors or people who know about AI but also elderly, young and even those who know zero about it\n\nThis phase 0 is so important and the interviews are such great reference points of data and will guide the chatbot to work for the users. She also said if any interviewee would love to be in the process that would be great\n\nPhase 1 will be building the AI chatbot that exudes human values and ethical systems when interacted with.\n\nAnd Phase 2 is the resource sharing system: such as time/volunteering, data, currency, crypto, compute resources. She spoke about how complex this phase will be because a system needs to be implemented of how time will be shared and how currency will be shared fairly. \n\nShe also explained roughly how the DAO resource sharing will work: how this will be specifically about how AI resources will be shared, how the resources are governed and how they are fairly distributed. An evidence-based resource sharing will give structure to the DAO. The data coming in from the population about ethics can help us structure the operational side of the DAO.\n\nShe discussed the definition of a knowledge graph and what it entails. The knowledge graph will organize the interview data, and use the transcripts to code them into categories such as geographical locations and concepts linking them. Which will help track patterns in the data. \n\nShe went on to explain what KG are for: They are used first to represent knowledge and they are designed to grow and change based on the data collected from the interviews. They also help provide a way for LLMs and machines to interpret knowledge. She emphasized its usefulness in policymaking, science, and decision-making.\n\nOnize asked about how testing for bias in the data would work and how the data would be handled. Esther addressed this by speaking of how that has been in consideration in the project and a team of data analysts will be set up to work on that\n\nVani raised the need to collect demographic data, such as sex, class and even career distinctions and Esther highlighted its importance in the interviews. They discussed what data to prioritise and how to keep it concise, but no clear decision was made. It was agreed that further discussion is needed to finalise the approach.\n\n\nVani suggested asking the interviewee about their identity and Colleen gave a template on how to ask that by saying; \"Do you identify with any particular group of people\"? , to which we agreed to be a nicer way to put it and implement it in the interview.\n\nWe confirmed that when interviewers submit their audio files, they should use the agreed file naming convention: the file should be named with the interview's reference number and the date. This is so that interview audio files remain clearly associated with the relevant consent form, and also means that if an interviewee gets in touch to say they wish to withdraw, we can easily find their interview to delete it.\n\nLeeloo announced the BGI Bookclub which would bring people together and inspire knowledge sharing. And it will be done biweekly beginning from October 16, and it will be open for the ecosystem to be a part of.\n\nThe meeting praised Duke and African Guild for their successful event. African Guild hopes to organize similar future events, based on positive attendee feedback. They plan to maintain the current event scale rather than expand to larger formats. It was agreed to discuss funding and potential Foundation involvement in more detail at the next BeGIN Open Office.\n",

Kenichi welcomed everyone to the meeting, and then Cjfrankie pointed out that he had completed the Q4 proposed draft for the Substack newsletter. Kenichi began to share his screen, and we glanced through Cjfrankie’s draft, and he shared more clarity and possible ways we could improve it.\n\nSecondly, Kenichi added that he’d be doing some research to find some articles for the board; he mentioned that this article would mark the completion of our Q3 KPI for 45 publications. Momentarily, he mentioned that the Zealy is 7 days away from completion; he then urged the scribblers to give their suggestions and ideas towards Zealy.\n\nWe also had a conversation about the Friday trivia game. It is very clear that the same set of people are always winning; it’s okay if they’re playing the game fairly! Kenichi shared his vision of purchasing a paid version of the Quizcord bot, which allows for private trivia; we could also check for people who aren’t playing the game fairly. By doing this, people won’t lose interest in the trivia.\n\nLastly, we went over the Q4 budget concerns that were raised by the objectors. Some of the concerns were that the budget was too high! We talked about how the budget reduction could slow down processes in the WG. From the Zealy and Twitter side of things, we’ve been able to achieve some remarkable feats. Some of the core elements in the WG still run on the free plan, e.g., Zealy, which limits the WG’s workspace, and we have no access to analytics.\n",

He started by asking the scribes if the published drafts on the community page had been edited! Cjfrankie answered by saying that Gorga submitted a few hours before the meeting; however, the review shall be done over the weekend. Kenichi also urges Ines to submit the Overcoming Nursing Challenge document to the community page. Moving forward, he sheds light on the MIX POST social media tool; he hinted that the video WG is already leveraging it and it’s time for the WWG to explore the tool. A lot of conversations happened in the chat — Ines Gavina, Lady Tempestt, and Gorga took to the chat to talk about exploring more social platforms like Reddit, Quora, and LinkedIn. Just some can expand our reach as a community. Gorga also showed interest in writing an article about the token event in Singapore featuring Jasmine from Rejuve.\n\nBudget Update: We tackled the budget discussion together. Following a discussion with the OpenGov call from 26th September, it is clear that our budget only needs a slight edit to have it pass. According to the Treasury, we only have to make a 20% cut, and to this effect, we glanced through the budget sheet to see the areas we could adjust. Additionally, Kenichi mentioned that moving forward, we’d be focusing more on ecosystem-related articles and Twitter threads while the community page takes a break since we have published quite some articles over the last couple of months. More so, Kenichi talked about reducing Zealy allocation and how WWG and the video WG are joining forces toward making Zealy a success. To keep Zealy fully functional, the video WG shall send some allocation while we keep running Zealy three times in a quarter. Ines suggested that we take our Spanish page management from the budget and have it led by the LatAm guild! Interestingly, we have reallocation funding coming into the WWG account; however, Kenichi is still in close contact with Tevo, and he’d share more detailed information as we move further along. Due to the budget rate, he stated that Zealy is on hold till further notice and that the Friday trivia shall become biweekly.\n",

See their context-setting doc here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaZTEaLkYkfxfJeN_9V82olsYDTC3gBIeaT2dQLY9Fk/edit?usp=sharing.\n\nAyo talked through the doc, and answered a couple of questions. We noted:\n- when the doc says \"fair\" distribution of tasks, it does not necessarily mean \"equal\" distribution (e.g. it might be fair distribution only amongst those qualified/skilled to do a task)\n- the idea that WG closures and work-assigning processes should be decided on a WG-by-WG basis, rather than program-wide, is a perspective that has been raised in Governance meetings before, and therefore will be added to the doc.\n\n2) We discussed and agreed (see \"Decisions\" below) how to progress this issue. The Focus Group's recommendation is that we run a consent process on the options listed in the doc. We discussed:\n - How would this work practically? Suggestions included asking people to select all the options that they might consent to; or using a weighted vote where people distribute e.g. 10 points across the various options.\n - Would this be a binding decision-making consent process, or more of a \"temperature-taking\" one?\n - Is it open to only Core Contributors, or everyone?\n - How can we generate further discussion while preserving people's anonymity?\n - How can we publicise the process and encourage people to get involved?\n\n3) We discussed and agreed the plan in the Rolling Agenda doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t39dwlwLYYB_1z_5szq1rnOH7mVTHe8Tmwv0R6ELOyE/edit?usp=sharing, for what will be covered in future Governance calls over the next few weeks.\nWe agreed that people will try to come a bit prepared for the first discussion (next Tues, 22nd Oct) by reading the doc \"Ideas for new approaches to budget decisions\", which came from previous Governance meetings https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jr_Yoq-d_WZWRMNcBFy-GkSNWFbm-VD2J14b69v520/edit?usp=sharing; and/or by looking at Jeremy Bolander's Miro about decision-making methods https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOsELu0U=/\n\n4) The issue of conflict resolution was raised, and it was mentioned that there have recently been some concerns raised about bullying. We referenced:\n - the \"conflict resolution\" doc that was produced by the old Strategy Guild https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beMEt9XmPvHNaH08Rh5_taTI0QhHcyy15Q6XcXXDWUI/edit?usp=sharing and suggested that we could look at it again;\n - the concept of having a team of \"listeners\" who can initially do non-directive listening and support anyone who is facing a conflict to decide how to deal with it\n - the idea that we might need some basic training on non-directive listening, and/or communi9cation workshops; and that we could look at trying to fund this in Q1 2025.\n\n",

On balance, we decided no (see \"Decisions\").\n\n3) What should be the timeline for the decision on Q1 2025 budgets? We based it on the timeline for Q4 2024, but allowed for a Christmas break starting c. Fri 13th Dec; and we removed the initial iteration where people just say whether or not they consent to each budget, because our last  retrospective showed that it didn't work well. So our agreed timeline is:\n\n        - WGs submit Q1 budgets and Q4 reports by Mon 25th Nov\n\t- Core Contributors submit their consent forms by Mon 2nd Dec\n\t- Discussion of objections takes place in Governance call on Tues 3rd Dec\n\t- WGs submit adjusted budgets in response to objections by Sun 8th Dec\n\t- 2nd-round consent forms are shared on Mon 9th December\n\t- Core Contributors submit their 2nd-round consent forms by Wed 11th Dec\n\t- Discuss and finalise in the OpenGov call on Thur 12th Dec.\n\nWe noted that this timeline means that WGs will be reporting on their Q4 work before the work is fully completed; so we agreed that WGs will be asked to report on October and November, with projections for how they expect their work to be finalised in December.\n",

It was suggested that if we want to move to voting, we should make an overt decision to do so, rather than introducing elements that turn it into a vote without a decision to do so.\n2) People canvassing for delegates was felt to be an unappealing idea, and also open to corruption - people could promise favours for delegating to them, or threaten repercussions for not doing so. A governance process should not rest on trust that \"Nobody here would do that\", but should be designed to be robust and safe even if people did.\n3) It perhaps only gives an illusion of increased participation and engagement with governance.

He proposed using a platform where hosts could input their availability for podcast sessions, allowing guests to select a date and time that works best for them.

Some time ago, we agreed that we should use people's Discord names for this, (\"Archive name = Discord name), and André has been looking at using a Discord bot to gather them. However, we notice that \"Archive name = Discord name\" has not been working that well - documenters don't apply it consistently, and particularly for new documenters, they might not know someone's Discord name if their Zoom name is different, so it causes confusion. So we have decided to use the name by which people have been most consistently recorded in the Archives, whether or not it matches their Discord name, to minimise the amount of changes that need to be made.\n\nAndré proposed the same approach as we plan to use for tags: it will be possible to add a new name, but it will not appear immediately in the tool but will need to be approved. This means that if a documenter accidentally adds a name for someone who is already there in the controlled vocab, we can fix it.\n",

This has had an impact on the work we have been able to do. We noted that not all WGs did this in Q4 - some made little to no attempt to constrain the amount they asked for, and their high original budgets were perhaps intended to \"give them something to cut\".

Firstly, Effiom shared an update on the status of the strategy core and strategy member tags 🏷️ He stated that the tags haven’t taken effect because there’s still a back-and-forth issue that needs to be fixed. He hinted that at the next meeting or workshop, he’d give an update on the status.\n\nBudget Fitting: Momentarily, we had a budget fitting walkthrough by Effiom; he added that some deliverables will be moved to Q1 2025 and there would only be 1 workshop session in Q4, while a few things are removed to fit the budget. \n\nQ4 Task Roster & Async Follow-up: Ayo took to the stage and assured everyone with their names on the roster of getting a task in Q4. We also featured a discussion about what to do with members who haven’t been showing up for meetings; Ayo added that we can swap those names with active members who would like to take up tasks. We also featured discussions centered around Q3 workshop follow-up. These groups of people will attend WG meetings (marketing guild, video workgroup, and writers workgroup,) and collect information about what strategy was adopted in their workgroup from the last strategy guild workshop and how it’s going. To this effect, we have Photogee and Ese to take on the Q3 workshop follow-up while Cjfrankie and Mikasa take on the Q4 workshop follow-up.\n\nMore on Workshop: We have decided that there will be only one workshop session in Q4. These workshops will focus on the R&D guild and education guild. These workshops shall commence next Monday and run for 3 straight weeks. In light of such, Cjfrankie and Mikasa are to attend both the R&D and the education guild meetings just so the workgroup can signpost three members that will represent them well.\n\nResearch Update: Effiom shared an update on the research he’s working on. He hinted that the survey form is complete and is ready to be sent out to gather responses from community members. Additionally, he sought to get some feedback concerning the survey and then encouraged members to check out the form and add comments, too.\n\nLooking Ahead: As Q4 wraps up, the strategy workgroup looks forward to having a promising Q1 in 2025. According to Ayo, he mentioned that the strategy guild welcomes research ideas, initiatives, workshops, and collaboration from members. As a matter of finality, he added that Q1 2025 won’t only be about facilitation and documentation. Rather, it’s about strategy stuff.\n\nAOB: The AOB session was led by Ayo, who sought two people who would liaise with the marketing guild in view of the content calendar — Just so we have any content for the socials, the idea is to have two people who would be in close communication with the marketing guild for proper scheduling of posts.",

Workgroups and Guilds have evolved over time.\n\nWorkGroups Budget Consents: Felix list-mentioned the workgroups that have achieved budget approval consensus based off the last meeting. This includes R&D, Latam, Education.\n\nPending: Strategy, Marketing, Writers, Video. The concerns raised on Video WG were resolved, so it was agreed that they have now passed. \nRE Writers WorkGroup, Kenichi said no new changes had been made to the budget total, as the concern that was raised didn’t speak to their final adjusted budget.\nRE Strategy, they have redrafted their budget and cut it from $13,000 to $8,000. Vani called for ethical governance. Felix and Ayo agreed that it was not ethical to respond to old concerns based on new budget requests.  \n\nAfter discussion, we noted that we believe the concerns raised on Strategy, Writers and Marketing have either been addressed by the WGs making changes to their budgets, or are not relevant/are addressing something that has already been resolved; so we agreed to run a new round of consent to check if Core Contributors agree it's all resolved. Closing date for submission of forms will be Mon 8th July 2024, with final discussion in the Governance call on Tues 9th July.\n \nAbout the Consent process itself: we noted that participation in the 2nd iteration was low (at most, 6 Core Contributors submitted forms). \"Consent fatigue\" due to repeated consent rounds? or do people not fully understand the process/not know that they have to complete a form again? \nDo we need a quorum?\n\nWe had the idea of setting up some sort of standard header for proposals, outlining abit what consent means, also letting people know they need to read the proposals before stating yes/no consent\n\nFelix and Ayo said the process should be more efficient: it may be more productive if WorkGroups can simply highlight concerns and responses to concerns. We suggested that WGs should document clearly in their budgets what changes they have made to address concerns raised.\n\nWe raised the issue of anonymity - Vani believes consent forms should stay anonymous, to ensure people feel free to raise concerns.",

          "narrative": "We noted that we had planned to send out a 2nd round of consent forms already, but due to some miscommunication, they have not been sent out yet, which changes the proposed overall timeline. \n\nAbout Writers WG and Marketing Guild, Kenichi explained that concerns raised in the last round of consent were about things that needed explanations rather than changes, so no new changes have been made to Writers' budget; so does it still need to go through another round of consent? \n\nFor Marketing, an outstanding objection (about the points system) was acknowledged by the objector as actually intended for Writers' WG, so Marketing seems to be resolved. Peter checked whether one of the other objections (that Marketing's budget had increased fourfold) was accurate - it wasn't.\n\nVani raised the issue of the low participation in the latest consent round (4 responses out of 53 core contributors) - is this level of response valid? Several people said we never agreed on a quorum, so we can't impose one now for this Quarter, but we should prioritise agreeing one for next time.\n\nReasons for low participation: Vani suggested perhaps people didn't realise there was another round - so if we do a 3rd round, we need to publicise it better.  Kenichi said people seem to drop out of the consent process once their own WG has passed - so now that there's only a few WGs left, most people are no longer participating. We need to educate Core Contributors better on the process. \n\nSome comments from the latest consent forms were accidentally not transferred to the Budget Planner spreadsheet. We noted that in future there should be a double check that all comments have been copied over.\n\nPeter added one comment from the consent forms which had been accidentally omitted - about Marketing Guild and whether all the work in the Marketing budget had been adequately costed. Kenichi addressed it, and it was resolved, so it was agreed that Marketing Guild's budget has now passed.\n\nBut we noted there may still be some concerns in the consent forms for Strategy Guild that have not been transferred to the Budget Planner, or covered in the doc that Strategy Guild created to address the concerns raised about them. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4s9TMi6zoi2RpGNIssNvppA1zTjpfsk-bnjqAfWfWc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWe noted that there have been significant changes to Strategy Guild’s budget since the last round of consent (a drop from $13k to $8k). In Strategy Guild's doc, concerns fall into 4 categories: 1) Budget amounts 2) The validity of what Strategy Guild aims to do 3) Deliverables 4) Miscellaneous/other. Ayo talked through the doc, and noted that some of the concerns are about the old Strategy Guild's backlog, and should perhaps be addressed by Treasury Guild and/or or Governance WG; and that the only concerns raised that have not been addressed in the doc are the ones which are not about the Q3 budget or Q2 quarterly report, but which speak to decentralisation and whether Strategy Guild should exist at all. \n\nTevo questioned whether some of the functions that Strategy Guild wants to do are already being done in other places such as Town Hall, Governance WG, and the WG Sync call; and whether replying to concerns via a \"comments\" doc like this is really addressing the issues holistically, or whether a new report should be drafted that takes account of and incorporates concerns.\n\nAyo addressed the question of overlap between different workgroups, and argued that it is often valid - groups might superficially appear to be overlapping, but are actually doing different things (he cited the examples of Onboarding WG vs the onboarding efforts that are carried out by different WGs individually; and the difference between Archives WG and Knowledge Base WG.) He noted that the way that the Program works is not to have one group tasked with doing everything around a particular category of work, but to have some types of work spread across several WGs who address them in different ways; and argued that this is valid. He said objections to Strategy Guild were based on a misunderstanding that the guild is attempting to strategise internally for individual WGs, when it's not.\n\nHowever, Vani noted that while it's true that different WGs should be free to do things in their own ways even if they look superficially like overlap, the objections to Strategy Guild were not really about this. They were not  saying that Strategy Guild is attempting to strategise for individual WGs; they were questioning Strategy Guild's attempts to strategise for the program as a whole, as opposed to this being done by a coalition of all the WGs together.\n\nWe also noted that although Stragegy Guild has discussed and addressed objections, this doesn't meant they are actually resolved, if the objectors haven't yet withdrawn their objections. So given that what Strategy is presenting now is significantly different from what people consented/unconsented to last time, several people felt there should be a new round of consent.\n\nTevo suggested an ultra-low-budget, step-by-step approach for Strategy Guild, building up to a bigger budget next Quarter if trust is built up. He pointed out that when the Ambassador Program started, people did what Strategy Guild are proposing to do, but with much less money; and that given there are objections from several people, the guild might be missing something.\n\nGuillermo raised a query on the $6,790 that is still in Strategy Guild's reserves from previous quarters; Ayo said that we should ask Treasury if Strategy Guild can use it, which would lower the amount they need to ask for in this Quarter's budget. Guillermo also noted some issues that have been raised (some people think Strategy Guild didn't work in its previous iteration; that strategy might be something we should all work on together; and that others have done similar kinds of research work for much less money). Ayo said that people are only objecting because they don't yet understand what Strategy Guild wants to do; and that the past iteration of Strategy Guild shouldn't be  raised as an objection on this budget.\n\nPeter summed up that there are clearly questions around the relevance and need for Strategy Guild; whether some of its budget items are needed; and whether it's aiming to do things that are actually just the Core Contributor role; so to minimise risk, he feels Strategy Guild should start with a much smaller budget, and see what happens.\n\nAlthough it was almost the end of the meeting and people were beginning to leave, Tevo quickly created a Zoom poll to ask what would be an appropriate level for Strategy Guild's budget; 3 people (who cannot have been Peter, Tevo, or Vani, who had already left) voted, and all said \"under 3,000 AGIX\". So this suggests it's not just one or two people who have concerns.\n\nAyo said that Strategy Guild could amend its budget in response to comments by tomorrow; and then a new consent form can go out. But after he left the call, Tevo and Peter said that perhaps this is not the best way to address the issues, and it should instead be discussed in the Open Governance meeting on Thurs. So there was no definite agreement on next steps; it will be decided async.\n\nKenichi noted that Writers WG reduced its budget last week (and the changes have not yet been discussed), and hasn't made any further changes since. So rather than another consent form, the changes should be discussed to confirm whether they address the concerns raised. Tevo pointed out that the issues for Writers were also about their quarterly reporting, not just their budget; and there was some discussion of Writers' doc addressing the concerns raised.\n\nThere was a concern raised in general terms about how long it takes for an objector to read through the answers and additional docs, and whether people can find the info that addresses their concerns.\n\nSo the final decision was to discuss Strategy Guild further in Thursday's Open Governsance call; and to create an send out a new consent form for Writers' WG\n\n",

          "narrative": "Kickoff: The African guild meeting began with Duke welcoming everyone to the meeting. He highlighted the fact that we haven't done greetings in different languages for some time now. We glanced over the minutes from the last meeting summary and no comment was raised.\n\nUpdate on Marketing Initiatives: CJ Frankie highlighted that there is no current update for now and they are still on it. Duke said that they need this to be completed before the end of this quarter.\n\nResearch on indigenous tooling: Onize stated that the research began in the last part of Q3 and this research is tailored to African needs to foster engagement within Singularity Net ecosystem and AI ecosystem. The research was carried out through a survey and was sent out to people both in and out of the ecosystem to have a broad grasp. It was noted that people highlighted pending issues they had and the major three were that they needed more education on what AI was doing to mitigate their fear, the second was that people wanted to see how advancing technology makes good health care and the last was that they wanted to see how developers will use the tool to make advancing technology. The issue encountered doing the research is that a lot of people don't like to fill long survey \nIn conclusion, she suggested that we should focus on tools that will educate the public, tools that will help health care professionals and we should create co-pilot assistance that would help developers and the public at large in an African way.\nDuke appreciated the team but noted that the recommendation suggested was good but generic that the guild is looking for recommendations of tools that African guild can create and it will benefit the SingularityNet ecosystem.\n\nTool update by Advanceameyaw: Advanceameyaw explained that tool explore on numbers. He said that math is everything, we know famous AI like chatGPT but the other aspect we don't know like mathematical models involved in it. This tool aims at bringing simplicity to the whole numbers and mathematical concern. He noted how math started from Africa by the Egyptians and we have to get to the core of our foundation. It will help our understanding and without mathematics there is no understanding of the universe.\n\nQ4 A.M.A Session Update: Onize said that they have reached out to our speakers and have sent them their itinerary and the date as being fixed for 29th November, 2024. Duke noted that the A.M.A is for everyone both in and out of the ambassador program and he encouraged us to invite our friends. \n\nWe welcomed new members and introductions were made. \n\nQ1 2025 budget: Duke said that there is a consensus in governance to have a tiered system towards the approach of budget in the new quarter with the intention to help us migrate the delay usually experienced within budget consent and everything that has to do with budget. So the African guild was given 8,500 AGIX which is equivalent to 5,270 us dollars. Due to the budget allocated we would only be focusing more on operational tasks that includes our recurring weekly task, our project and workshop session and others. Duke requested an additional 1,500 AGIX to increase the total to 10,000 AGIX, but it is still pending. The finalized budget fitting will be presented to the Treasury before the 25th of November.\n\nAOB: Tee inquired about the research document, expressing interest to follow-up in the research. Duke said that the research has been concluded and also noted that we are taking a bit of a slow down on conducting more research because we have already done quite a number of researches in the pipeline. And we are now full blown into our implementation phase. So all of the outputs that we have already gathered from our previous quarter  research will now be used in Q1 of 2025 where we are now implementing.\n",

Some concerns were raised about whether this connects with Onboarding's existing processes, and whether the Collaboration Skills Database info is in a useful format: the Database currently uses a lot of free text, which can take time to interpret; and we queried whether controlled vocabs would be better and would give more usable info.

We agreed on $20. Vani will add tasks to Dework.\n\nGuillermo has created a timeline infographic RE: budget submission deadlines. He and Vani will proofread it after this meeting, then start sending it out. Meanwhile, Ese has been sharing the infographic reminding WGs of budget submission date.\n\nFinalising Governance WG's own Q3 report and Q4 budget: Guillermo has drafted the budget, and shared it in the Governance Discord channel a few days ago. So far, no comments. We set a final deadline for comments/edits of Sat 7th Sept;  but essentially, we signed it off. Clement has drafted the quarterly report - same arrangement, we basically signed it off in this meeting, but final comments or changes are possible until the end of Sat 7th.\n\nQ4 consent process: when to calculate new Core Contributors list and run the opt-in process? It needs to be done by Monday 9th, as the consent process begins then. We agreed for Tevo to do it (and he noted that he is aiming to automate it for next time). We also noted that being a Core Contributor is supposed to be an \"opt-in\" thing - so someone, probably Peter, will need to ping people and invite them to opt in. We noted that doing this on Monday is cutting things fine in terms of the timeline, but there is no alternative for now.\n \nVani had created a draft initial consent form (i.e. just a list of all the WGs and \"consent/object/abstain\") a while ago and posted in Governance Discord channel. (The purpose of having this initial form, with no rationales required, is to make it quicker and simpler for people to participate in a first round, and \"weed out\" the WGs whose budgets everyone consents to - last quarter this was around half of all WGs - so that the next round only focuses on the groups for which there are objections.) We tweaked the introduction to the form, which was too long, and might be offputting for people. The form now needs to be moved to the Ambassador Gmail account before it is sent out.\n\nWe discussed how far the consent forms are really anonymous (see \"decisions\" below)\n\nWe discusssed what \"Abstain\" means, particularly in the final consent round, when WGs need to get at least 80% consent. (see \"decisions\" below)\n\nWe re-discussed and confirmed what will happen if budgets are submitted late i.e. after deadline of Mon 9th Sept. (see \"decisions\" below); although we did not finalise the exact process for how the \"small operational budget\" will be decided on; we agreed to discuss it later if it actually happens.  Tevo suggested that those who do not want to make the effort to submit a budget request by the deadline probably do not need funds, but the \"new ideas\" budget of 2% can be accessed by anyone who really needs money.\n\nWe discussed whether we want to move to a different decision-making method, other than the consent process we are currently using. We noted that Consent was only ever adopted as an experiment, so we can change; and we noted that the consent process has become quite consuming, with most of Governance WG's time being given over to it. We mentioned alternatives including Consensus; weighted voting; sortative or aleatory processes (such as a jury);  Consultative; or creating collective funding proposals rather than individual WG proposals. Objections were raised to voting as a process, because it doesn't give room for discussions, reasons, objections, and doesn't work to increase community engagement. There was interest in Consensus and Consultative processes; and some comments in favour of continuing to explore Consent processes because it encourages listening, ideas, and iterating, despite problems with having too many iterations in the process. It was also mentioned that R&D guild plan to build a dashboard to make the consent process run smoother.\n\nWe briefly revisited the discussion on \"Increasing participant numbers, with a non-increasing programme budget\" which has been covered several times. We felt it may still need discussing again - and particularly, the question of whether we should be training people, or just giving tasks to those who already know how, and looking at capability. We noted that the issue was initially raised when token price had recently dropped dramatically; but now it has recovered a bit, do we see things differently?",

And for long videos, we’ve got barely 6-7 slots left.\n\nKizzy reminded the house of the memo sent out earlier regarding the conversion rate. Thus, all proposal must be at 0.55 Agix which is going to  lesser the amount we’re getting.\nHe added that the Q1 budget proposal is calculated at 20% cut on all recurring tasks and for Quality control, the 20% cut comes after the number of videos reviewed .\nKizzy announced that due to the budget constraints, the number of video productions will be reduced drastically. For shorts, we’ve resolved at 2clips per week( one short from scratch and one short clip) \nAnd for long videos, only 11 videos per quarter. \n\nKizzy ceased the opportunity to speak on the new approach to the zealy programmed.

We began by reviewing the action items from the last meeting, including Kenichi's publication of the November 2nd ecosystem digest on Substack. Cjfrankie encouraged everyone to read, subscribe, and engage with the newsletter if they haven't already. \n\nDework Task Update: At the meeting, members like Lady Tempestt, Gorga, and Cjfrankie had ongoing tasks assigned on Dework. Lady Tempestt delegated her draft, 'Apespaces 🍌: What is Twin Protocol AI,' to Mikasa. Cjfrankie and Gorga have pending tasks and will make their submissions soon. Mikasa also added that she’d be expecting the ecosystem digest draft from Cjfrankie by tomorrow.\n\nExploring Web3 Publishing Platforms:  Following a discussion on Medium page monetization, we decided to explore more Web3 publishing platforms. To this end, we have identified some potential tools, including Mirror, Lens, Paragraph, Arweave, and Warpcast. Cjfrankie highlighted the advantages of monetizing on Web3 platforms, such as decentralized revenue streams through NFT sales, direct ownership and control over content and revenue, community building via tokenization, and enhanced privacy and security. Additionally, we aim to learn more about these platforms, so Cjfrankie assigned some WG members to conduct research and present their findings in the next meeting. This research will cover each tool's functionality, how DAOs can use it, and pricing. Cjfrankie chose Mirror, Mikasa showed interest in Lens, Emmanuel Isaac selected Arweave, Love was assigned Paragraph, and Evelyn took Warpcast.\n\nQ1 Budget and Q4 Report: Lady Tempestt sought clarification on the Q4 budget and Q4 report preparation status, Mikasa cleared the air by saying that the Q1 is drafted already while the Q4 report is in progress. Lady Tempestt insisted that we share the DRAFTs in the WWG channel just so everyone can see it and leave comments. \n\nContent Calendar: As a matter of finality, the meeting featured Kateri, who kicked off a discussion about getting a list of email addresses from the WWG, these emails will be given access to the content calendar so posts across the social will be unified, time bound, and reach a wider audience. We called it a day and we ended the meeting at 3:30 PM.\n",

          "narrative": "Kick-off:  The weekly WWG meeting started at 3:15 PM with a welcome greeting from Cjfrankie. We began by reviewing the action items from the last meeting, including the publication of the November 9 ecosystem digest on Substack. Cjfrankie encouraged everyone to read, subscribe, and engage with the newsletter if they haven't already. \n\nRoblox Walkthrough: The meeting featured the likes of LordKizzy, OEP, and Devon—the gamers guild members. According to LordKizzy, the gamers' guild members are in the WWG meeting to ask questions about the workgroup! Additionally, LordKizzy and Devon will join forces to develop a workspace for the WWG on Roblox Studios. With screen sharing, LordKizzy showcased the video workgroup modules and sections that have been built on Roblox; he also had some interaction with some of the WG members on the platform; the presentation was paramount and interesting indeed! It gave us an insider perspective of how the platform works and how the WWG will be built on Roblox. \n\nMore on Roblox: Immediately, Devon took to the floor to ask the workgroup some questions like: \n\n‪What does the writer's workgroup do? Cjfrankie describes the WWG as a group of people passionate about writing who bring clarity to complex topics. We often use an 'explain like I’m five' (ELI5) approach in our articles to make them easier to understand.\n\n‪What platforms do we use to publish our work? We make use of platforms like Medium and Substack.\n\n‪What is our onboarding process like? Cjfrankie described the WWG onboarding process as a test-based process, where aspirants gain access through a simple text document. The scribblers (writers) then review the test, and if it meets the threshold, the aspirant receives the scribbler tag—that’s it!\n\n‪Does the WWG pay for attending meetings? Cjfrankie clarified that scribblers earn points for attending meetings. Additionally, participating in WG activities like note-taking and suggesting articles also allows Scribblers to accumulate points. These points are calculated at the end of the month, and the monetary value is then sent as a reward to the Scribbler.\n\nWho is the WWG lead, and is there a form of hierarchy in the workgroup? ‘Kenichi, of course, said Cjfrankie. ‘The workgroup doesn’t have a strict hierarchy. After the lead, we have Scribes and Scribblers; no one is ruled over by another. The roles simply distinguish our responsibilities. For instance, Scribes have higher responsibilities and recurring tasks, while a Scribbler may suggest articles, write articles, and attend meetings, Cjfrankie added.\"\n\nHow do you want the WWG logo to be designed? Cjfrankie suggested that we have a logo of a book with a floating pen, which basically describes what the workgroup does. Gorga also mentioned that having a library would make a lot of sense, too. Last but certainly not least, we listed all the active members of the workgroup, namely Kenichi, Lady Tempestt, Mikasa, Cjfrankie, Ashley, Gorga, Ines, Devon, Slate, AJ, Emmanuel Isaac, Evelyn, and Eric Davis. \n\nExploring Web3 Publishing Platforms: After the Gamers Guild completed their presentation, we had a short session on Web3 publishing tools. First, Emmanuel Isaac presented on Arweave, Mikasa shared documentation on Lens, Cjfrankie discussed Mirror, and Evelyn showcased Warpcast. The purpose of this research is to determine the next platform we should try out. We want to understand how they work, how DAOs can use them, and their pricing structures.\n",

Kenichi welcomed everyone as usual and highlighted the reason we couldn’t join the call earlier—the marketing guild call is ongoing! \n\nExploring Web3 Publishing Platforms:  Momentarily, we delved into how we can move forward with our publication. Cjfrankie shared some of the research documents from the last two meetings. And we talked about how we can expand. Then Ines discussed getting some graphics for the recent article she wrote “The Consciousness Explosion,” which is around 19 minutes long. Kenichi added that he would edit the draft and schedule it for publication, while Gorga volunteered to make some graphics for the draft. \n\nBudget Cap: Before now, we had so many views for Q1 2025, however, there’s a limit to what we can do—we hope AGIX pumps. This led to Gorga asking about his proposed Indonesian page in Q3. Kenichi clears the air by saying that we’re at the 10,500 AGIX threshold and we have removed items on our Q1 budget so that we don’t come out short. He added that new initiatives might not be able to come in, including the Indonesian page. He also discussed the importance of getting a separate wallet to enable the WWG to swap the budget to stables and reward writers with AGIX instead of USD-based rewards. Nonetheless, he added that the page can be created now, but it will have little attention. \n\nTwitter Premium: Kenichi hinted that the writers' workgroup cannot get metrics from the Spanish page and the Pidgin page because we do not have any premium plans. He added that any page that will increase 1000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) will get a premium account, and the allocation for managing these pages will be different. \n\nMonthly Stats: As we say goodbye to November 2024, we reflect on our journey since the beginning of the quarter. We glanced through all the social media accounts (X, Substack, Medium) to see how they performed in November, and the numbers and stats were quite impressive. We also revisited our Q4 report to see if there are any changes we can make. \n\nSingularityNET Ambassador community: Kenichi introduced the new SNET community launched on X. He hinted that the page is up and running, and he encouraged everyone to join the community including the social media managers, so he can make them moderators. From a bird’s-eye view, the community is built to unite, empower, and celebrate SNET ambassadors by connecting and sharing knowledge. Lastly, he added that there should be more interaction on X by replying to questions from community members. As a matter of finality, Kenichi said that the points system rewards for November would go out next week on Tuesday, and he urges every writer to check the boxes.\n",

          "narrative": "Tasks on Github\n\nWe started by going through tasks “in progress”;\n-We went through feedback from the Admins (Co-chair and mentee by Vani & Colleen, WG async support by LadyTempestt, GEI reportbacks by Jenn and the WG internal management by Sucre) on Github where Sucre suggested that we pick 2 or 3 skilled documentors for our meetings to rotate by Q4 and that meeting summaries need to be completed before the end of the week so they can be closed out. These issues will be closed next week and Vani will create a fresh one against quarter 4 if we get funded.\n\n-Event in Nigeria: Duke gave an update on the event holding in Nigeria in collaboration with African Guild this week; he said they are currently publicizing the event, everything is going as planned and it will take place this weekend(on Saturday). He said that he will share the virtual link for those who will watch online. Vani added that by next week we should be able to get a report back from Duke on how everything went.\nModeration of the AI Ethics forum: The admin team will take a look at what is the best way forward for payment before the next meeting.\n\n-Leeloo gave an update on payments for the AGI-24 pre-conference and the main conference contributors said that GEI is still working on how to make it seamless through the ambassador program or GEI directly instead of using the foundation’s suggestion of an invoice since some people involved might not be allowed to use that payment method. She added that Esther would reach out to Vani concerning the people who can send invoices for their payment.\n\n-Documenting GEI Open Office: Jenn is doing them in batches and will get the second one in by Wednesday this week.\n\nWe went onto tasks in “to-do”;\n-We talked about paying people who came to the training session for interviews now that the token price is good. \n\n-Q4 budget: We got one objection( the objector said they were not clear on what exactly our WG does or our main objectives) but it is not really a strong one since we have made this clear in our reports and WG description so every core contributor was requested to go approve our proposal if they think we should get funding. We also discussed a few items on the budget.\n\n-Concerning the Q3 interviews, the task has been transferred to personal issues for everyone involved and every assigned person is expected to move their issue on GitHub to “in progress” once they begin the process and add comments on how the interview went I.e hours spent, reference number, any thoughts on what can be changed and improved. Clement is the first interviewer who got the task done, he said that he followed the steps gotten from the interviews’ training and it made everything seamless. Ese asked if interviewers are to formulate questions for the interview themselves and Vani said that there were not any definite rigid questions but there are general principles about what kind of questions one needs to focus on in the slides Interview training AI Ethics WG from the interviews training session and if she or anyone is unsure, they could post their questions to seek advice in the private channels for Interviewers.\n\n-Q4 Interviews: We asked anyone up for it to jump in and put in their name although the budget for it will be dependent on what we get for funding next quarter. Duke and Vasu expressed interest in it. We will be clear about the budget next week.\n\n-AI Ethics conversations: This issue on Github will remain under “to-do” for a while since we have done that already during the AGI-24 Pre-conference and the chill-out rooms during the main conference although it might be revisited when we come to look at our budget for Q1 2025. \n\n-AI Ethics WG: Money questions \nIf a person does a task badly, should we pay them? And who decides what is bad? Is there an issue about capability when assigning tasks? Does the WG have the capacity to mentor people? Colleen suggested an Ad-hoc decision cos it's subjective and a voting system. Love asked how do we rate “How badly a task is?” PG suggested having expectations for a task established in advance, and measuring what people do against guidelines. Leeloo suggested a rotation of self-elected reviewers. Ese asked “How do we judge “badly”? Sometimes task execution style varies per organization. She made an example by saying that what she might view as bad might be different from what Vani sees as bad. Vani pointed out that PG’s suggestion above might sort that out and that if a task is so bad that it has to be done again then that becomes a problem. Leeloo suggested that maybe just seeing things as either incomplete(didn't do the task) and partial complete (did the task but missing needed material?) might work.\n\n-Vani and Love also shared a belief that If someone does not know how to do a task, they should not step up. They could also ask for mentorship - but this is ONLY if the WG has the time and money to do that; LeeLoo agreed by adding that we will always make out time to train people when necessary like we did for interviewers so they should come for it if they are interested and that if there is no time for such training then WG members should evaluate their skills and make sure they are not putting themselves up for something they can not do. Vani also added that there are going to be times when the WG won't have the time or money to offer mentorship.\nOn the topic of subjective; Vani pointed out that just because something is subjective it doesn't mean that we can not decide on it and that so many things we think are objective are not.\n\n-We also discussed some guidelines(what is expected from the interviews) and possible issues that could come up with payment for WG members doing interviews this quarter and the next. The guidelines are in this sheet AI Ethics Workgroup stuff!  and have been posted in the private channels for interviewers.\n",

(NOTE: for the Q1 budget decision, the form simply asked people to consent to all the budgets en bloc, or not.)\n\nThe objector also raised the issue of reserves: \"It's better we do have spare budget allocation taking advantage of the (high) AGIX price because there could be days where the price doesn't remain as high as it is.\"\n\nWe reminded ourselves of the consent process we agreed on: if anyone objects, even if they are in a minority, their objection will still be discussed and addressed; and only if the issues cannot be resolved will the consent form be re-done. The second time, the budget will pass if 80% of those responding are in agreement, so that a single objection does not derail things completely. So we agreed that yes, we do need to address the objection in a meeting, and scrutinise the budgets of Writers, Video and Education WGs. We also noted that it can be daunting to be the \"lone voice\" who stands up and objects to something that others agree with - but that nevertheless, the onus is on the objector to justify their objection.\n\nKey discussion points:\n- does the consent process generate excessive overhead? (Stephen)\n- how centralised is the process? (Stephen)\nWe noted that in the past, the budget approval process was done by a closed group of \"Ambassadors\" (about 7 people). Raising this to 31 Core Contributors inevitably brings additional overhead, but this is fundamentally a positive and decentralising move. \n\n- The burden of justifying a budget, and constant enquiries into the minutiae of whether a budget is valid, can be negative and even malicious; e.g. in Cardano's Project Catalyst, where people have been trolled with constant sealioning inquiries about their budgets. Scrutiny cannot be ongoing indefinitely, and there needs to be some onus on the objector to justify their concerns. (Stephen)\n - Perhaps WGs should have autonomy to use their budgets on whatever they think is valuable; so in future, the decision shouldn't be about picking holes in individual totals, but more about whether WGs have explained their budget and whether they have put systems in place to track whether they've spent it the way they said they would; and about whether their budgets fit the total Program budget. (Vani)\n\n- Conflict of interest: funding recipients are also the decision-makers on funding. As a structural, point-of-principle issue, there should be a treasurer role (group or individual) who does not receive any other funding, and only validates budget requests. (Stephen)\n - It would be difficult to find someone to do this, since everyone is involved with a WG in some way (Peter).\n - Since we want to take an experimental approach, we should be ready to make changes from Quarter to Quarter, and take risks and try new approaches. (Felix).\nThe meeting agreed this issue should be looked at further, and noted that it might take time to resolve. \n\n- Closed Discord channels: if the objector can't see the details of what a WG is doing because they can't see the group's Discord channels, that's not the objector's fault (Peter)\n- Workgroup autonomy: if you're not part of a WG, you don't really know what goes on in that group, so your objection might not be valid - and if you want to preserve your anonymity, there is no way forward (LadyTempestt)\n- Anonymity in decisionmaking - the person who raised the objection isn't here (Stephen)\n\n- Work quality: Victor outed himself as the objector.  Example of high costs from Writers' WG of $100 for a single article. Are there checks on the quality of such articles, or on whether they reach their target audience, and whether any engagement is authentic and not farmed? (Victor)\n- Importance of attending a WG’s meetings before objecting:  Writers’ WG has addressed all these questions in our recent meetings (LadyTempestt)\n- It’s fine to want to scrutinise the quality of each other’s work - but that needs to be a separate discussion, and should not be brought into the decision on budgets. We all have different ideas of what type of work is worthwhile or valuable - and in a decentralised ecosystem, different opinions are valid. If we are autonomous,  we should not try to enforce our ideas of valuableness by trying to withold budget from each other. (Vani)\n- What would need to change for Victor to consent? Maybe if we recognise we need to improve quality control and we created a separate initiative to look into the quality of WGs’ work? (Felix)\n- Importance of understanding a workgroup before commenting (Tuso)\n- Initially I wanted to track WG funding with KPIs as we do in Deepfunding. But I now think workgroups can justify their budgets, so I would go against my previous feeling, and consent. I plan to attend more meetings to understand how the ambassador program works (Victor)\n\nSeveral people expressed thanks to Victor for raising the issues and being prepared to break his anonymity.\n\n- Sharing info: Maybe we need to make basic information more available to newer people - a brief for each workgroup, what they take in money, what they deliver, and how that is approved and accepted. But we don’t follow the more formalised process that is used in DeepFunding - here, a more organic system has evolved. So we might never have people reviewing the milestones of each work group, because we're not at that scale, but we might take a step towards that by communicating so people can easily access that information. (Stephen)\n\n- Decentralisation vs standardisation on monitoring budgets: The current approach is a quarterly “broad sweep” approval - we don't check every single deliverable before releasing funds, it's not like milestone-based delivery. For simplicity, I prefer this approach; but getting funding should mean *some* responsibility. I would agree with a standardised way of explaining budget spending, and demonstrating where the money went. That doesn't jeopardize the decentralization too much. (Peter)\n\n- Style of reporting: Currently most groups write a narrative quarterly report. Perhaps it should be more spreadsheet-like: for each line of your budget, a short note to say how you dealt with it - whether you spent it all, and what you produced. Each work group could find their own way of formatting that information - all those different approaches might help us find something that works for everybody. (Vani)\n- I would agree with more standardised reporting:  part of the quarterly report should include a very easily understandable overview of which funds are spent, how, what the outputs are, the deliverables (Peter) \n- Quarter two budgets: Based on what we have learnt this Quarter, what would be a valid reason to approve or not approve them? Some people in the room feel it’s about work quality, but we haven't defined what we mean by “quality”; and other people don't think that's the issue at all, so we need to have that conversation.

What kinds of events should we prioritise? (particular topics? virtual or IRL?) \n4. How should we make the decision on who goes where?\n5. How do we track the outcomes?\n\nOn 1, we came up with a list of key aims (see \"Decisions\" below), and noted that these should influence what kinds of events we attend. We also discussed possible outputs: including the idea of short, vox-pop type videos on core questions about AI (similar to what was done in Panama). We noted that these could be shared on social media, and could help publicise sNET's ideas. We noted that, due to the lack of a robust consent process, such videos wouldn't be admissible as primary source material for BeGIN's research; but perhaps, if shared on social media, they could constitute secondary source material on people's opnions on AI-related questions.\n\nOn 2, \n- Esther noted that depending on the type of event, the Foundation might be willing to fund conference attendance sometimes\n- We discussed whether and when Ambassador Program reserves should be used (see \"decisions\" below\n- we suggested that perhaps there should be a cap/maximum per person that we should spend.\n- other suggestions on funding were that \"plus-1\"s shouldn’t be covered, nor should staying longer than the length of the conference, and if someone wants to return to a different airport than they departed from, this should only be permitted up to original costs of one-way.\n\nOn 3 and 4, we didn't decide definitely what types of event are most important; but suggestions included \n- a) Events that discuss decentralization, particularly in AI, but also in web3 communities as a whole\n- b) Events that discuss AI and AGI \n- c) Events that discuss AI ethics issues (rather than events about business, or trade shows, etc)\n- d) Virtual events, for \"carbon footprint\" and cost reasons; \n- e) Twitter spaces and similar, as well as major conferences \n- f) Events in places where we have a lot of people - for example, West Africa - or in places that we have regional focus (Latin America, Africa)\n- g) Selection of who attends should be at least partly based on who is nearby, to minimise travel costs - but that this would have to be coupled with looking for events in places where we have a lot of people.\n- h) We raised the issue of whether we could push for BGI-25 to be in an African country; but the location has already been almost selected for this year (still confidential), so perhaps we could lobby for an African location in 2026.\n\nOn 5, we noted that we should track results based on the specific event; we should set specific objectives based on our list of core reasons to attend (see \"decisions\" below); but we might want to steer away from rigidly quantitative KPIs, and focus more on an assessment of meaningful outcomes (For examplerather than counting how many people we speak to, attendees should try to give an honest assessment of how useful they thought it was). We noted that attendees might have a tendency to exaggerate the value of attending; and we discussed the need to make it possible to say \"it wasn't useful\" if it wasn't, and capture information from attendees on how we could make it better. We discussed asking attendees to write up a short summary evaluation of their attendance at an event (what went well, less well, what they learnt, how we can learn from any failures) which could be added to the Archives and referred to ahead of the next event. \nWe agreed that the question of tracking results needs further discussion.\n\nWe noted that different WGs might take a lead on different aspects of planning, depending on the nature of an event.\nWe also mentioned the issue of how to decide who is able to (for example) represent the Ambassador Program at an event, and the possibility of mentorship to help people do this. (Twitter spaces could be a way to develop this.)\n\n",

Our agreed agenda is:\n\n- Tuesday January 7th - Why did those who did not take part, not take part? Results of Peter DMing non participants. And: Does the Foundation/the decision makers fully know what the Ambassador Program does? How to make them aware? Among others: End of year report\n\n- Thurs 9th Jan: Compulsory participation in governance - yes or no (for individual Core Contributors) (for WGs)? Also - penalties for WGs for not taking part in governance, yes/no? \n\n- Tues 14th Jan: Retrospective on Q1 2025 process \n\n- Thurs 16th Jan: WG budget cap - processes around it, how to change your cap?\n\n- Tues 21st Jan: WG autonomy/ New WGs?/Outputs. This covers:\nProcess for starting new WGs? And merging WGs??? \nhow do we determine which WGs are producing “valuable” outputs - or do we? CAN there be an objective standard on this, or is it a matter of opinion?\nWG autonomy as a principle? (this links to the above, and to validity of objections). \nIncreasing numbers vs, non-increasing Program budget\nPeople’s capability and whether/how we assess it / Should WGs train people?  (already started discussion, see Governance WorkGroup Session 30th July 2024)\n\n- Thurs 23rd Jan: As above, continued\n\n- Tues 28th Jan: Self nomination to Core Contrib status - yes or no?- (was briefly discussed on 21st Nov 2024, but no consensus, so discuss again at a later date.), Must a Core Contributor have a wallet - yes or no? and Is everyone happy with Core Contributor criteria?\n\n- Thurs 30th Jan: Anonymity in the decisionmaking process - yes or no??\n\nFebruary: Looking at other decisionmaking processes besides consent - we said that we would do this in Q1, but will do it if it is agreed that we still want to. Could do it just as education rather than with a view to changing our process",

          "narrative": "The meeting had a slow start, with only a few people in the call at the beginning; but eventually was quite well attended.\n\nEnd-Of-Year Feedback\nWe agreed to send out a Google Form to all workgroups, asking what they think the content of these WG Sync calls should be in future. Questions:\n1) Did you attend any of the WG Sync calls in 2024? Why/why not?\n2) What type of topics would you ideally discuss during this monthly WG Syncing call? Options:\n- Sharing best practices\n- Collaborative efforts/shared initiatives that all WGs could take part in\n- Tooling\n- Resolving conflicts between WGs\n- Resolving conflicts between individuals\n- Discussing any issues or problems with the Program as a whole\n- Addressing any responses to the standing Ambassador Program feedback forms\n- Other\n3) Which topics do you think should NOT be part of the WG Syncing call, but addressed elsewhere?\n\n\nExisting Ambassador Program feedback forms\nWe noted that there are 2 existing feedback forms - one on the Program as a whole https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee0oIRpKd2I9tlqt_-QxQMK_wdZNHlmM9BqG61jWy2W8QhWw/viewform, and one for specific WGs https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSckE_kso56kdeJfYcfEezAzKJzcTqFJ6Ej9yySalpMN7SL1uw/viewform. We suggested that we should check to see if they are still useful and worded in a way that is meaningful; if so, they should be monitored; and that the WG Sync call could be a good place for any issues raised to be discussed.\n\n\nWG Sync rolling agenda\nWe noted that there is a rolling agenda doc for these meetings, but it isn't getting used much; perhaps we need to publicise it more, e.g. in Town Halls and in Discord.\n\n\nAmbassador Program Reserves\nWe had a discussion about the Ambassador Program's financial reserves, and what they might be spent on. \nPeter confirmed that the Program itself does have a large reserve, which is separate from the reserves of individual WGs. We noted that there was a meeting earlier this week https://snet-ambassadors.gitbook.io/singularitynet-archive/timeline/2024/december-2024/week-50#ai-ethics-wg to discuss the issues around the Ambassador Program attending events, which touched on whether event attendance should be paid for by using reserves; and a \"task group\" is going to meet on Friday to discuss this specifically; but there are likely other things that people might want reserves to be spent on. A quick brainstorm suggested the following:\n    - Resurrect the \"New ideas\"  budget?\n    - Training, skillsharing,  mentorship - including coaching e.g. for presenting at events and Twitter spaces? and pairing ambassadors with experts, offer one on one coaching sessions?\n    - Resurrect the podcast? Or move more towards X spaces instead?\n    - Research/interviewing people about AI-related topics?\n    - Organising our own events,as well as attending those organised by others?\n    - Make a commercial?\nWe agreed that these and other ideas will need to be discussed further.\n\n",

          "narrative": "Guillermo's answers to the objections on LatAm Guild's budget:\n\n1) The budget is too high: Guillermo stated that this affects the entire program, since in Q3 the market price was low. Vani also noted that LatAm's budget wasn’t the highest. Guillermo ended by saying that there’s a need for a better strategy to address this.\n\n2) Concerns about overlapping with the work of other WGs: Guillermo pointed out that the issue of \"overlap\" for regional Guilds has already been discussed in a previous Governance meeting, and there is already consensus that African and LatAm Guild are complementary to the program, and that it is valid for them to do tasks like onboarding, marketing and education independently, in ways that are appropriate to their particular region; so this objection is not valid. He cited the example of African Guild's \"Ubuntu and AI\" conference was held last Friday and Saturday. Guillermo noted that in terms of operations, LatAm Guild has independent sub-groups for communication, education, etc.\n\n3) Concerns about Lack of report, budget allocation, and Transparency: Guillermo noted that LatAm's budget for Q3 was down by about $2,000 after budget fitting and the group had to still deliver with that. He said the comment about the Q2 budget being shared by 2 individuals was not valid, because how the funds were going to be disbursed was captured in the Q2 proposal; at the time the Guild had only 2 founding members but before the start of Q3, the number had increased and the new members who joined and delivered on task were rewarded.\n\nPeter pointed out that this last concern could have been refuted by the quarterly report, as it seems to be recurring. Guillermo noted that the activities of the Guild are on-chain and are verifiable on the Treasury Dashboard, also stating that there are summaries that report the activities. In response to the concern on transparency, Vani noted that since the objector was evidently able to see how funds were disbursed (i.e. that only 2 people were rewarded in Q2 and more were in Q3), surely that demonstrates that things are transparent? \n\nGuillermo then highlighted some of the impact and contributions the LatAm Guild has made to the Program. He announced the Hackathon with the ASI collaboration initiative. Colleen appreciated the Hackathon initiative and the work being done by the Guild. \n\nGuillermo ended by saying that it is important not to overlook these concerns, because we get to learn and he believes in this process. Peter appreciated Guillermo for addressing these concerns, as the objector would get clarity from listening to his perspective.\n\n\nDiscussion on objections and the consent process\nVani suggested that instead of discussing the objections about specific WGs, which can become quite confrontational, we should pull some of the concerns and questions raised and discuss them in general. Peter agreed that is the way to go about it.\nShould we continue with this existing consent process? Vani noted that she doesn’t think people are convinced we should.  LadyTempestt expressed her issues with the current consent process, and how it takes time and can get confrontational. \nVani noted there is a need to have a conversation about what a metric is, as this has been a recurring concern.\n\nLadyTempestt asked about the expectation of Writers' WG coming back with a reduction to their budget - they have done so, but it doesn't appear to have affected the current lowering percentage for budget-fitting.  Peter pointed out that there is an error in the sheet which could explain theis - it will be corrected.\n\nFinalizing on the Task list for Governance WG in Q3\nVani shared the spreadsheet. She noted that some tasks don’t have a price allocated to them, and some, we don't know who did them. She asked people to have a look at it, especially those who had done a task in the WG in Q3.\n\nRetrospective on the entire Consent process\nVani suggested a retrospective on the entire Consent process experiment overall, across all the time we have been using it, in addition to the normal retrospective on how the process went this Quarter. This was agreed; and we agreed that such a session will need some planning.  Effiom noted the feedback gotten during the session would inform the context of whether it’s a retrospective of the entire process or just this quarter. ",

          "narrative": "Vani gave an overview of consent decisionmaking and how it's supposed to work:\n- There needs to be an actual proposal to consent or object to.\n- Consent = absence of actual objections, not perfect agreement - so \"Safe to try\" and \"good enough for now\", not complete agreement. \n- Need to ask objectors \"What would need to change to get your consent?\" - so rather than people trying to mold the proposal to fit their ideal, they just talk about what they specifically object to, and think would be actually harmful. \n- Decisionmaking is supposed to be in the hands of those who are closest to the issue; so it's \"how does it harm *you*?\"\n- In line with WG autonomy (as raised by Duke in the Q4 retrospective, and several other people over time), objections shouldn't be about what *you* think a WG should be doing - it should be that you are responding whether what the WG wants to do is \"safe to try”, OR if you think it would cause harm, then \"what harm would it cause? And what would have to change for you to consent?” \n- Vani suggested we have gone away from that, and somehow turned the process into a vote, not a consent process, especially with the “80% approval and 20% objections\" rule. People are not responding as though we asked “Is it safe to try?”, but are giving lengthy analyses of how WGs should operate or should have been operating; and maybe that is what is making the consent process so difficult this time. She noted that most of us are educated to make decisions by voting and are less familiar with consent, or consensus, or consultative processes.\n\nOur use of a consent process was originally an experiment.  Experiments should be documented and evaluated. \n \nWe went through insights from past retrospectives (Q2, Q3, Q4): see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GorEmCJzcrq3b73p1XUa8E7yYD7_UQETt9axt89qff4/edit and added some of the issues raised to our Rolling Agenda doc:\n- should someone have a wallet to become a contributor? \n- Self nomination to become a core contributor? \n- Guidelines to what a “valid objection” is \n- Workgroup Autonomy (how autonomous should WG budgets be?)\nVani suggested it might be useful to look back at documentation of the past meetings where we addressed these issues, and pull together some of the key points raised, to help the discussion in future meetings. Ayo was of the same sentiment.\n\nOn the point of “getting feedback through DMs from core contributors on why they don't take part in governance decisions,” Peter said it is a good idea to continue doing that.\n\nPeter pointed out that having an outline on what a report should look like or context setting via this suggestion; “Find a way to avoid the verbosity and over-complexity of some reports and budgets e.g. an outline of what to include, though not an actual template”  would be a good idea seeing as we do not have that in place now.\n\nWe discussed including \"participation in the the budget consent process\" as part of the “participation” that maintains someone's core contributor status; and how we would record and track this, since it doesn't appear on Dework (usually, someone's level of participation is calculated via tasks on Dework). We have said in the past that we would record participation in the consent process onchain (just the fact that someone completed a consent form, but not the details of whether they consented or objected), but it's unclear if this has been done yet. Peter said that he thinks it's a good idea to acknowledge and register participation in the governance process.\n\nGuillermo shared an experience on the decision-making process of what happens in the R&D Guild: a milestone-style process. If someone is funded in previous rounds, and they deliver, let's say that's closure, milestone one. If they want to participate in the new community voting for new development, they will need to start from the beginning. And that way they go through the check and balance of the re-roll. Then the community goes through the process of consenting or not. He added that maybe there is something we can learn from this.\n\nWe basically glanced through all the rest of suggestions in the Retrospectives doc with no full discussion on it.\n",

They might consider presenting feedback during workgroup meetings, allotting 5-10 minutes for discussions, and documenting insights gathered from these sessions.\n\nQ4 research report by kizzy: The strategic guild's research report for the ambassador program highlights key strengths such as collaboration, strategic planning, and resource management, while addressing challenges in communication, role clarity, and resource allocation. It provides actionable recommendations, including enhancing inter-guild communication, fostering collaboration, and aligning resource allocation with community feedback to improve overall effectiveness and alignment with the program's objectives.\n\nCommunity Conflict Resolution Update: Tuzo reported that the issue raised within the community has been addressed, with both parties engaged, one showing remorse, and emphasized the need for a conflict resolution guideline to streamline future cases.\n\nUpdate on Guga's Absence and Conflict Resolution: Tuzo reported that after reaching out to Guga, he was unresponsive and uninterested in addressing the issue, and has not attended recent meetings, suggesting the team move on and focus on other matters.\n\nPhotogee also reiterated what Tuzo said, expressing frustration over Guga's lack of response and his desire to move on, which has left them feeling like they are the ones carrying the responsibility for the issue.\n\nAyo explained that after Goga criticized the Q4 budget, an independent committee was formed to investigate the matter, with Tuzo, CJ, Franki, and Photogee serving as neutral members to reach out to Goga and present evidence, though Goga later reassured them that the issue was now resolved.\n\nQ1 2025 Budget Update and Strategic Initiatives Overview: Effiom provided an update on the Q1 2025 budget, highlighting that the estimated costs remain close to the previous quarter's budget, with a total of 2,200 USD allocated. While most operational costs stayed the same, a few areas, like workshops and research, had their budgets reduced. Effiom also mentioned that, due to limited funds, only one research initiative would be undertaken instead of the planned two. He emphasized the importance of feedback from the community to guide the research selection process, with members encouraged to contribute ideas during the holiday season. The bi-weekly meetings and the workshop structure will remain the same for Q1 2025.\n\nQ1 2025 Strategic Planning: Ayo clarified that the submission of ideas for research and workshops will be done asynchronously, allowing members to think and submit their ideas, which will then be discussed in detail during the first meeting to plan the quarter, especially regarding research and workshops.",

We noted that if those who object are not present, this means they must accept that the decision will be made by those who do attend.\n\nKey points raised:\n - the comment (not an objection) about the group's GitHub Board not being under the Ambassador Program github organisation: accepted as a valid question, and the group will consider moving it; but as it's not an objection as such, it doesn't affect the budget decision.\n - the meeting could not see any similarity between what AI Sandbox does, and what R&D does, so could not understand the objection that the two groups are doing the same thing.\n - AI Sandbox's work *is* a form of community engagement and community contribution, so the objection that there is a lack of these things is inaccurate.\n - several of the objections seem to be based on a misunderstanding of what the group is trying to do - for example, it doesn't aim to focus on assessing tools built by the community, but on tools (often commercial tools) that might be used by the community.\n- To the objection that AI developers and specialists should be invited to be involved in Sandbox sessions, LordKizzy (speaking on behalf of the workgroup) noted that although this would be good, it could incur costs beyond the group's budget. However, Peter offered to ask around at the Foundation to see if there are people who would be prepared to get involved for no cost.\n\nThe meeting also noted that several of the comments are not really objections, but suggestions. Since no specific harm was identified, and no solid reason not to approve the budget was given, these points are not valid as objections. The person suggesting these things should progress them, if they want to do so, by joining the workgroup and working on the issues they have raised.\n\nOverall, the meeting agreed that the points raised have been sufficiently answered, so the group's budget has passed.\n\n",

          "narrative": "NOTE: this is a detailed summary, because those present were keen for all the ideas and insights to be documented so we don’t lose them.\n\nWe noted that due to the recent AGIX price rise, the lowering percentage for budget fitting will be a little less than anticipated, but still high, at around 28%.\n\nNo prior items on the agenda, so Peter opened it to the floor.\n\nSucre n Spice raised the question of problems with the current budget process (unreasonably high requests leading to a difficult budget-fitting process; etc). In the past we used agreed percentage allocations to each WG (see spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h6yTQGvkNhp-88a3wRCTxpKTpC24d4kIOWj1mpWrmxU/edit?usp=sharing  for details) and WGs simply had to work within their agreed allocation - would it work better to return to this?\nIf we did, the arguments would be about what percentage each WG should have, rather than about budget totals - but at least there is a constraint (it has to add up to 100%), whereas the current process has none, and WGs are expanding their budget requests ad lib. \nShe noted that the current process was always intended as an experiment, so we can change it.\n\nPoints raised:\n- We could shift to AGIX-based allocations rather than USD (Peter) Might make things easier, as it's the coin we work with (Kevin); but people think in fiat, not AGIX, so it's less intuitive. Also, budgeting in AGIX shifts the burden of token price fluctuation onto the WG or individual, not the Program overall, which feels unfair. (Vani)\n\n- Or, fixed prices for tasks, as in DeepFunding, where it's either $10 or $20 depending on the task. (Peter)  But that takes away WG autonomy - a WG should be free to pay more for a task, e.g. documentation, if they choose. WGs can spend their allocation as they see fit, then give a quarterly report so others can check if they think the WG used the money well. (Vani)\n\n- Have tiers for the percentage allocations? because some WGs are cheaper than others to run. (Vani)  But the WGs who have historically requested and got higher budgets would end up in a higher tier, regardless of how justified their high budget was (Peter). And what would be the criteria for allocating a WG's percentage? If some WGs historically have asked for more budget, do we question / examine that? And do we assess their outputs, rather than just basing it on an average of what they have requested in previous Quarters? (Clement)\n\n- Have a pot for WGs to use if they go over their budget but they're doing good work (Kevin)\n\n- When AGIX price was higher, WGs got very ambitious - but now price is lower, WGs should  recognise that they can only afford basic operational costs plus one or two projects. Or, if they want to continue doing the same work,  they have to pay less for tasks. (Sucre)\n\n- Let’s decide which of these suggested changes are \"safe to try\", and try them out, rather than just talking about them. The current budget process isn't working, in that it takes up too much of our time. (Love)\n\n- First step should be a retrospective of the whole of this budget process, over several Quarters, and analyse how it has affected the way workgroups operate. Then collate all the ideas for alternatives, so we can properly discuss them  (Vani)\n\n\n- We might need to merge some WGs; and we need to stop proliferating new ones. We now have 21 WGs; each of them adds budget overhead. (Sucre). We should have due process for starting a WG - we can’t afford unlimited WGs.  (LadyTempestt). Merge WGs, especially ones that are just subgroups of the same guild; and /or reassess whether we even need some groups, in terms of their outputs or in terms of our overall direction for 2025. What we need will change over time - some WGs might need to end to allow others to start (Duke).\n\n- Be careful about consolidating WGs, because decentralisation. Each WG has its own character; let’s not force people to consolidate with others who might be superficially similar, but are approaching it in different ways and learning from each others’ different approaches (Vani)\n\n- We should be more output-driven: e.g. end-of-quarter meetings where WG leads explain and justify their budgets (Duke)\n\n- The *number* of WGs might be a red herring - as long as they’re low-budget, and temporary, it might be OK. (Vani) But in practice, workgroups don’t end once they’ve done a job. So probably, a WG once started is here to stay (Sucre)\n\n- Budget caps? rather than the current “ask for any amount, and then do budget-fitting”? Because currently some WGs barely reduce their ask in response to lower token price, and nothing is said. Caps could tame this, and could be determined based on outputs, and/ or the Program’s overall priorities. (Duke)\n\n- What do we value and want to fund? The discussion could get poisonous if we’re not careful, but maybe we need to discuss it. There are divergent opinions and no right answer; percentage allocations would mean different WGs can do what they value, without a lengthy process of everyone having to approve every detail of others’ work. (Vani)\n\n- Split it into “operational” budget and “project” budget? All WGs get the same for the operational costs of running a group, but different amounts for projects (Sucre). “Project” allocation could be based on an average of what the WG has spent over the last 4 Quarters; and it would be what the Program can afford to give, not whatever the WG asks for. The WG will then do what it can with what it’s given (LadyTempestt), Some WGs spend a lot on tasks that are not really important to the Program. Can they be honest enough to cut those tasks? Or do we need to help them recognise it, via a consent process? (Sucre). \n\n- “Operational cost” and “project cost” might not work for some WGs. For those who produce content, it’s all “operational”. So tiers, based on average budgets in the past, would be best. There are already de facto “tiers” in place - some WGs have had consistently high spends and others consistently much lower (LordKizzy).\n\n- There might be problems with averaging out the last few Quarters. Firstly, some WGs didn’t exist then; also, some WGs did more project work and requested more budget when token price was higher, but cut back when it was lower, whereas others haven’t cut back. And finally, some WGs overpriced certain tasks when token price was high, just to use more budget.\n\n- The last time a percentage allocation system was used, there were broad tiers (LordKizzy). But today, we have different needs, and different WGs might be in the “top” tier - so we need to assess it based on what we’re now focused on, not just on what a WG got in the past. I’m not sure how far back we should go (Colleen).\nI feel token price is the crux of the issue. If AGIX was at $1, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. So if we get a tier system in place and then token price rises, would we revert to the current system? And should we start submitting budgets in AGIX? (Clement). In Onboarding WG, although we submit our budget in dollars, we work it out based on an assumed exchange rate (Sucre). If we did all calculate our budgets in AGIX, we would know what we have, whether token price goes up or down (LordKizzy)\n\nTo be discussed next meeting, on Tues 17th. (Love).\n",

AdvancedAmeyaw has done 3 so far and is looking to finish his Q4 interviews by the 7th of December. Onize is done with her Q4 interviews, Ese’s interviews for Q3 and Q4 are progressing just fine. We are not moving interviews “in progress” to “done” yet until the validity of the interviews has been confirmed(listening to them and more) by Esther, LeeLoo and Vani.\n\nModeration of the AI Ethics forum: Clement is doing fine here, nothing dramatic yet lol.\nPre-AGI roundtable AGI Chill out rooms rewards: It will not go through the Ambassador program Treasury system but it will come directly from the Supervisory council. Esther reached out to people involved, and rewards are supposed to go out this week. Leeloo will reach out to her for confirmation.  The issue will remain open till further notice.\n\nAdmin Team Roles: WG Internal Management, WG Async Support, Cochair and Community Manager have all given updates on what they have been doing.\nAI Ethics Event: We are looking to meet before the end of this quarter to discuss in a session what kind of events(virtual & physical) we can attend next year.\nDocumenting BeGIN meetings.\n\nWe went onto tasks in “to-do”;\nHow long should we keep Q3 interviews open? Especially the ones in “to-do”. CollyPride and LadyTempestt suggested the end of the year or before we all go on holiday. CallyFromAuron suggested we wait till Q1, 2025 and if there are people with Q3 interviews that are yet to be done, and other people interested in doing the interviews in Quarter 1 then we should reallocate.\nWe will look at producing Educational Resources to demystify basic AI Ethics Terminology & Ideas and Rewarding people who attended the training session for interviewing skills again in Q1 if we have extra budget. \nSucre won't do Q4 Interviews anymore, Ese will get to hers soon.\n\nWe also went through our Q1 budget Items: We will assign some specific items to people at the beginning of January or our first meeting next year. Colleen, Ese showed interest in this budget item;“ideation on how to get donors”. Onize, Duke, and possibly Stephen are interested in Knowledge Management and Data Analysis. If AGIX goes up we might be able to get Transcription done using ReadAI and edited by the interviewers.\n\nWe also went through and finalized our Q4 report.\nSurvey Sharing: We tested it and so far it just needs to be tweaked a bit so it can go out but it might not be before the end of the quarter. \n",

Key discussions included scheduling the Q4 budget decision process, creating a context-setting document to explain the Q4 decision process, and recalculating who is a core contributor for Q4. \n\nWe discussed why some Core Contributors do not participate. Peter has DMd those who didn't, and has had some interesting replies - several did not know they *were* a core contributor, or didn't know the dates or how to take paert in the consent process. This all suggests we need to do more publicity about the budget consent process. Peter will create a doc with the (anonymised) replies he got; Guillermo will produce infographics to help publicise dates and process for Q4 so people are more aware; and Ese will create documents during the process to keep people up-to-date wuth what the objections are, which WGs' budgets are still not agreed, dates of discussion meetings, etc. We also noted the im[ortance of creating and sharing a context-setting doc to explain the process.\n\nWe discussed financial strategies to address token price fluctuation, risks of converting Program reserves to e.g. a stablecoin, and market implications. We also discussed (but did not definitely agree on) using a percentage of reserves (suggestions ranged from 10% to 50%) to cover WGs' budget shortfalls due to drop in token price during Q3. We noted that 10% is already set aside to cover token price drops; there was discussion of whether WGs themselves have reserves they could use; there was a suggestion that each WG could put forward one thing from their Q3 budget to be funded from reserves. There was also concern about dipping too much into reserves to cover the shortfall, and a suggestion that WGs should simply re-fit their budgets and prioritise, although it was also recognised that with such a big price drop, this could be very detrimental to WGs' work.\n\nWe discussed how to improve Workgroup representation at governance meetings.",

We noted that not all work groups have reserves. Also some WG reserves are for work that has already been assigned, and thus can’t be used for anything else.\n\nShould WGs be prioritising maintaining the WG itself (meetings, documentation, etc); or project-based work? We recognised that this will vary from workgroup to workgroup, but it might affect what kinds of budgets are submitted for Q4. We suggested creating a doc to pull together ideas on how to prioritise and how to reduce your budget in times of low token price.\n\nShould WGs be given their agreed budget at the start of a quarter, in tokens, and manage token price fluctuations themselves? This would require each WG to have its own multi-sig wallet. We noted that this idea has been discussed in the past, and was rejected for several reasons; the meeting made no decision on it.\n\nGuillermo is finalising infographics on \n1) the deadline for proposal and budget submission for Q4\n2) encouraging Core Contributors to take part in the consent process. \nWe agreed on wording for these - we noted that it needs to say \"consent process\" rather than \"vote\" or \"consensus\", and that it should talk about being part of decision-making/governance. Of the options Guillermo suggested, the meeting liked the slogan \"\"Your Voice Shapes the Future!\"\nAlso discussed contrast ratios, and making sure the infographic is legible for those with poorer contrast vision",

He suggested that a Twitter thread would be best to portray the event. Gorga agreed to make the thread and send it to Mikasa after it’s done.\n\nSeptember Points System: Unfortunately, the points system rewards for September didn’t go out because the WWG ran out of funds. Kenichi tells the WG not to fret. The reward can still happen next Tuesday. The floor was opened for suggestions — Lady Tempestt, Cjfrankie, Gorga, and Mikasa insisted that the reward go out regardless because we did a lot of work in September. Kenichi added that we can cap the distribution to $500 and have September rewards go out from the Q4 points system allocation of $2000+. We also discussed the importance of having a personal wallet in Q1 2025.  \n\nZealy and Trivia: Just so you know, Zealy has been scrapped! and has been moved to be the responsibility of  Marketing Guild. Meaning no more Zealy reviews for the Scribes. Kenichi also stated that the weekly Friday trivia will now be run on a biweekly basis due to lack of budget. He hinted that the first Friday and last Friday of each month would be a good time slot for the trial. The first Friday will be dedicated to WWG, and the last Friday will be dedicated to Marketing guild.\n\nWWG TEST: As a matter of finality, we briefly talked about how to review the pending Writers' Workgroup membership tests taken by the aspirants. Lady Tempestt asked why we are still reviewing tests, given that the WWG is closed to new people. Kenichi explained these were pending submissions from last quarter and should be attended to! Then, we can talk about how to close test submissions for Q4 and perhaps open up again in Q1 2025.\n",

Kevin Frey piqued interest in the recently released X space “Longevity, Biotech, & Web3: How DeSci is Shaping the World.” He commended Rejuve for their work, and mentioned that he had close communication with Rejuve to see how biotech could help women Olympians in 2028.\n\nQ4 Budget: Mikasa, Lady Tempestt, Gorga and Cjfrankie set the Thames on fire as we tackled discussions around the Q4 budget. We discussed splitting the budget to stablecoin, and keeping the remaining half in the foundation token (AGIX). We’re still skeptical about doing so if it’s not within the Treasury management. Cjfrankie is tasked to chase André or Effiom to get more insights into the swapping of AGIX to stablecoin, and if it eventually becomes a reality, will the treasury hold it? \n\nFollowing that, we discussed how to reward the outstanding tasks from September 2024. We also decided that those tasks won’t go unrewarded. So, the treasury should offset all Q3 pending payments with the Q4 allocation. There was a conversation about creating a multi-signature wallet to properly oversee our budget and know what’s coming in and going out. On the flip side, we agreed that Treasury would have access to this wallet's seed phrase, and it would have 5 signatories. Mikasa also highlighted some of the key reasons why AGIX's price dropped lately. \n\nMore on the Budget: Kenichi also shared a brighter outlook on the budget by discussing how a bot can help simplify the multi-sig. Using the treasury bot, for example, he hinted that the bot can ping the wallet signers, give updates on transactions right inside the WWG channel, and more!!",

Kenichi then apologized for not keeping an eye on the channel.\n\nWe began officially as we ticked off the action items from the last meeting: following a discussion with Tevo and the Treasury, Kenichi is waiting for the Treasury to update their dashboard so the WWG will know how much we have left and how we can move forward. Lady Tempestt shared insider tips in the last open Treasury guild call, which featured legal issues with SNET foundation and tax implications that might arise from converting AGIX to stablecoins like CUSD or Djed, seeing as the treasury system is not an exchange of any sort. \n\nMore on budget: Our conversation had a smooth leap forward as we discussed more on budget and how we can distribute tasks fairly amongst the Scribblers given the latent fact that some Scribblers do not get the chance to write very often. Lady Tempestt’s comments were positive; she added that WWG should stop onboarding new people and only take on important drafts such as niche-based articles. She also suggested  that we should pre-plan our content and assign them to interested Scribblers at the start of the month or quarter, so every Scribbler gets a chance to do a task, and that this doesn't mean that Scribblers still can't suggest additional articles. Kenichi liked the idea and said he's been looking forward to us doing this through the Notion board.\n\nLooking ahead: Cjfrankie led a discussion on the monthly Substack newsletter. He pointed out how the Substack newsletter has lagged significantly and how WWG is not keeping up with the publication timeline due to the late submission of summaries. For this reason, the WG should remove it from our deliverables. Cjfrankie proposed the idea of something called “Ecosystem Digest\" - a short newsletter that contains links to recent AI news, events, and meetups in the ecosystem. Not just links to recent updates: there’d be a brief write-up to accompany those links. He suggested that WWG should give it a trial to see how it turns out. Additionally, we had discussions about how we can start leveraging Notion to organize and map out content and how the Scribblers can start using it because currently, only the Scribes have permission.\n\nKenichi suggested having a unified content calendar, to help Video WG, Translators, Martketing Guild and WWG work together.",

Immediately, we surfed the Dework board to check out some tasks in progress, and then Kenichi mentioned that he would assign deadlines to the DWeb3 series threads. He also started a conversation around the ecosystem page and the community page, noting that no article has been published on the community page since the 1st of October. Momentarily, he hinted that we should have an end-of-the-year recap draft, covering the entire achievement and milestones of the WWG in a year. He also talked about the successful Twin Protocol token launch on Uniswap, and suggested that the WWG should write something to publicize it.\n\nBudget: There is now less money in the proposed Q4 budget, because some Q3 tasks were paid from the Q4 budget. In light of this, Kenichi said that he’ll fit the Q4 budget. This discussion led to Kenichi’s suggestion to shift from USD-based payments to AGIX-based payments. Lady Tempestt commented that AGIX-based payments will result in members being underpaid. Kenichi quickly responded that the WWG is not shifting its focus to AGIX-based rewards; rather, rewards will be sent based on AGIX calculations, since AGIX’s price isn’t stable! This way, we can streamline our budget spending so it doesn’t affect the workgroup, which can make us run out of funds.\n\nOpen Discussion: Cjfrankie and Kenichi started a thrilling conversation on how the ambassador program can explore new things to leapfrog to greater heights. We shared some potential ideas on possible initiatives that can motivate the foundation, which can lead to funding. Due to some recent events, the African Guild, LatAm, and four articles from the WWG were spotlighted by the SNET Foundation, so we should give them more reasons to support the ambassador program. We also shed light on how some Web3 communities are doing great things out",

Stephen is aiming to structure the work as an autodidactic/self-learning approach, almost like a course. We have been questioning what we expect to use generative models *for*, and what we expect them to do; and looking at using (human) data analysis and data mining *before* we apply an LLM. Standard augmentation is usually about applying a **context** - so, what contextual constraints do we want to put on our use of a generative AI model in the context of the Archives? We need to be aware of where the data is structured and where it is unstructured (i.e. free text in meeting summaries), and look at how to structure data in a more constrained way (we note that JSON uses a \"tree\" structure, which has some parallels with the hierarchical structure of a traditional archival catalogue; and we can also see parallels with the approach of a knowledge graph database). Eventually we may use LLMs to help create semantic queries/prompts against an SQL database - so a hybrid of JSON/SQL rather than an actual knowledge graph.\n\nThis might also have implications for the redesign of the Summary Tool, in terms of how much of the data in a meeting summary is structured (and in what ways) and how much is free text. \n\nSee also, updates in the relevant issues at https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/225 and https://github.com/SingularityNET-Archive/SingularityNET-Archive/issues/222 ",

Cjfrankie introduced a new tool that might work better than read.AI “speechlogger.com.” \n\nWe skimmed through the minutes from the last meeting and we kicked off from where we left off. Kenichi started by asking the WWG members whether we want to make an end-of-year recap and how we are going to do it! Cjfrankie suggested that using meeting summaries might help; Kenichi brought the idea of exporting articles and statistics from the SingularityNET Ambassadors Medium page.\n\nWhat’s next for Medium: It is worth mentioning that the SNET Ambassadors Medium page has been able to amass 318 followers and surpass 1,000 views per post. Kenichi hinted that it’s time we run a partnership program where writers can get paid for their publications. Also, he mentioned the fact that reaching 1,000 followers would mean that we could run ads and content outreaches. Momentarily, Cjfrankie shared the idea of exploring other Web3 publishing platforms like Mirro.xyz, while Kenichi talked about Paragraph.xyz and its potential. We’re looking to explore the power of Medium before we publish across multiple platforms.\n\nBudget: We had discussions about the Q4 budget and projected timeframe for submitting the Q1 2025 budget proposal as well. With screensharing, Kenichi surfed the Treasury dashboard and tackled the budget discussion with Lady Tempestt by showcasing how much we have spent and how much we have left. Thankfully, Q4 is looking promising already, and we thought of adding some deliverables (such as the Indonesia X page), Zealy, and whether to allocate funds for graphics. Kenichi also hinted that the Marketing Guild’s Zealy campaign will start pretty soon.\n\n",

            "Impact of AI on Jobs Market: How will AI affect job availability in various industries like manufacturing, healthcare, education? Peter gave more insight into this - he said it’s getting seen as AI will take over our jobs and leave us with no jobs, he noted that in Manufacturing for example workers have already been replaced by automation; but AI also creates jobs in AI itself, developing AI for manufacturing; while in healthcare, AI is expanding human lifestyle through research using AI, for example organisations such as Rejuve Bio.",
            "Which sectors are most likely to see job displacement, and which are poised for growth due to AI? Advance said that in manufacturing, it is mostly in Western economies where many things are being automated, not like in Africa where there is still much industrialization.",
            "New Skills for an AI-Driven Economy: What skills will be most valuable in the workforce as AI continues to evolve? Clement said skill development should revolve around skills that can allow people to easily adapt to AI changes into what is being needed. He believed that the critical skill is adaptability. Advance gave more insight about it which is to understand.",
            "Human-AI Collaboration: In what ways can AI enhance human productivity, creativity, and decision-making at work? Lord Kizzy said that AI and human collaboration is important in the sense that AI can't go beyond what the programmer programmed for it, so it needs humans for their creativity to bring up new ideas.",
            "How can companies foster collaboration between AI systems and human workers, rather than replacing them? Kateri said AI can never replace human creativity because AI can't do more than what they are programmed to do, but humans are creative thinkers able to generate ideas; then in the aspect of problem-solving, AI is very good at analyzing problems but it can not completely solve them, it can only bring out ways to solve the problem.",
            "Automation vs. Human Creativity: Can AI fully replicate human creativity and problem-solving, or will certain tasks always require human input? Malik said that AI can't replace human creativity.",
            "Ethical Considerations of AI in the Workplace: How can we ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly, avoiding bias and discrimination in hiring and performance evaluation? Peter said that AI are not biased and can’t discriminate.",
            "What are the ethical implications of using AI for employee monitoring and decision-making? Advance said under the decision making AI is a little biased. Clement dropped more insight that states AI running through certain codes and would agree that the ability to monitor and decide is going to be based on certain lines of code provided, based on pattern recognition. So we can tell the AI model, once you see someone doing this particular stuff, grade it as excellent or grade it as good or grade it as poor performance, and so on.",
            "AI Performance Ratings and Future Implications: Lordkizzy decided to play a little game with the house by rating AI‘s impact in the future (10 for the best thing humans have ever seen and super beneficial, 0 for AI will fade away in the next 3-4 years, -10 for AI will cause more harm than good and is likely to be a disaster).  \n- Malik rated it nine out ten\n- Advance rated it minus ten and ten\n- AJ rated it seven now but in future lower to five\n- Clement rated it five, reflecting on the balance view of the whole stuff\n- Colleen rated it minus ten and ten\n- Guillermo rated it minus ten and ten\n- Kateri rated it nine and minus eight\n- Peter did not give a ratings to this. \n",
            "Lord Kizzy summarized the session by stating that one observation he had from the discussion is that AI is not going to fade away in the coming years. Its wider impact is yet to be seen but AI is here to stay."

          "discussionPoints": [
            "Meeting coordination and Introduction: Lord Kizzy welcomed everyone and explained the process of the debate. ",
            "Kateri started the debate with a brief introduction to the history of how technology has impacted education. She said that throughout history, each breakthrough in technology has improved education, from the printing press of the 15th century to the invention of the computer in the 20th century.",
            "1. Personalized learning: From the proposition team, Kateri said that AI enables personalized learning, by tailoring educational content to the needs of individual students. This allows every student to progress at their own pace. She said that learning platforms like Coursera and Anhad Academy use AI algorithms to help recommend content that matches each user's learning space.\n\nFrom the opposition team, Clement highlighted that AI lacks the depth of understanding to account for emotional and social factors that influence learning. He highlighted the story of Ben Carson, saying that AI cannot bring the actual solution anybody needs. He explained how education is not just about delivering information but about fostering curiosity, building problem-solving abilities, and emotional growth, which AI doesn't account for. He also stated that the educational platform Coursera just uses algorithms and thereby misses out students' unique strengths and challenges that human teachers would notice, and can even miss out the fact that the student failure can be due to emotional challenges faced in family or society.\n",
            "2. Enhanced access to education: From the proposition team, Kateri said that AI can expand educational access to underdeveloped communities. Through AI platforms, students in rural areas can still gain access to high quality educational resources that were previously unavailable to them. This ensures that students all over the world have opportunities to learn from the same resources despite the language of the resources. She also said that AI tools like Google do not just make the resources available, but also conquer the problem of language barriers, so articles or videos being said or written in a language the reader doesn't understand can easily be translated to a language they know. \n\nFrom the opposition team, Clement raised the problem that most AI tools are internet connection dependent, and students or researchers in underdeveloped communities may not have good Internet access. He stated that although AI can remove language barriers to some extent, it will miss out the cultural context that a human teacher or human educator would have accounted for. He also stated that if a white person is developing AI tools to be used by Africans there will be a lot of bias, and it will fail to convey important cultural content.",
            "3. Automating administrative tasks: From the proposition team, Advanceameyaw highlighted that every individual craves for automation, and it has existed for a long time. He noted that automation of administrative tasks like grading, scheduling and student management can be handled by AI tools like Gradescope or Google Classroom. He further said that if AI handles the administrative tasks, it will leave the teacher free to work on the students' emotional development, which will enhance the students' engagement, creativity and critical thinking among themselves.\n\nFrom the opposition team, Clement highlighted that this point contradicts the proposition team's first argument. He said that AI's ability to focus on administrative tasks is a major benefit, but there is a huge rate depersonalizing educational experience. He also said that teachers being present is needed because otherwise, who do we ask questions of when we do not understand?",
            "4. Risk of over-reliance on AI: From the proposition team, Advanceameyaw stated that AI is a tool and not a replacement for human interactions. When you see an AI tool doing all the task, it is not there to eliminate our critical thinking. He said that AI is human knowledge accumulated in silicon or in an application for us to assess -  we use AI to get the information that we need and then through our creative thinking we are able to work out that information and turn it to relevant data. \n\nFrom the opposition team, Gorga highlighted that over-reliance on AI is very risky. Clement added that there are studies that have demonstrated that AI is tampering with human creative thinking (for example, Zhai, C., Wibowo, S. & Li, L.D. \"The effects of over-reliance on AI dialogue systems on students' cognitive abilities: a systematic review\" Smart Learn. Environ. 11, 28 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1186/s40561-024-00316-7). He concluded that yes, it is fine that we get information from AI but we also need to bring human input and that is where the problem lies because 'who is there to define where to draw the line?'",
            "5. Equity and accessibility issues: From the opposition team, Gorga highlighted the point that the assumption that AI can automatically bridge the gap for underdeveloped communities fails to consider the reality of digital devices. He noted that students in low-income areas lack internet access, devices, technological support, and ways to be able to make AI tools more accessible to them; and even if they were able to gain access to the tools, the tools are often designed in such a way that students would not be able to make relevant use of them to study.\n\nFrom the proposition team, Advanceameyaw highlighted that if an AI tool benefits one set of people rather than another region of people due to accessibility, that means it is a challenge to that region's contribution because it is obvious that the tool belongs to everyone, but it hasn't reached everyone due to different challenges. He noted that knowledge is neutral and that it belongs to anybody, but the unequal access to tools is the challenge.",
            "6. Data privacy and security: From the opposition team, Clement said that data privacy is an ongoing concern, not just in an educational context, but in general. He stated how data privacy laws are still lagging behind the technology; that is why in AI Ethics workgroup, they are still having discussions on how they can securely handle interview data. He also noted that we need to talk about how the data is being used and who has access to it, to ensure that it is not used for personal profiles. \n\nFrom the proposition team, Kateri highlighted that AI platforms are designed to support data privacy and security measures. She stated that we all know that data cannot be secured 100% - previously, data were stored in files and that endangered student privacy, and even the data itself that was stored from natural and human disaster, but AI platforms can help security with a strong encryption. Example stated was WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption.\n\nClement countered Kateri's points and said that we should remember that it is humans who operate the programs, but if there is misalignment of intention, it will lead to something else.",
            "7. Potential job displacement: From the opposition team, Gorga said that as AI becomes more common in education systems, there is a concern about job displacement, especially for administrative staff and teachers. He noted that instead of teachers interacting deeply with the student, it will turn teachers into facilitators who manage AI tools, and will make teaching of less value. \n\nFrom the proposition team, Kateri said that AI is not here to replace the teacher's job, but to improve it. AI allows teachers to focus on their unique strengths (moral and emotional support to the children) and giving space also to nurture the students, while AI handles the repetitive time-consuming tasks.",
            "8. Reshaping educational models: From the opposition team, Gorga said that AI is changing education by pushing hybrid learning, and this may seem progressive but it risks taking away important face-to-face interaction that helps develop emotional intelligence. Clement added that we are prioritizing market-driven skills over holistic education, and this will just produce students that are only trained for specific jobs and that are not encouraged to exploit other intellectual pursuits.\n\nFrom the proposition team, Advanceameyaw stated that those in certain regions have difficulties in getting access to important material, and now that there is technological advancement, AI has given the chance to have hybrid and blended learning just with our smart phone, which has helped to assist education in those regions that are lacking."

          "narrative": "We went through the issues on the GitHub Project Board.\n\nQ3 & Q4 Individual Interviews Updates: \n- Even when people have completed their interviewing, the Issues need to stay in \"In Progress\" until the BeGIN/Nexus team have had a chance to review them and ensure they meet the validity criteria.\n - LadyTempestt will nudge those who haven't yet given updates in their respective github issues: Ese, Gorga, Kevin, Vasu, Advancemeyaw, Yemi (who might have dropped out of the Program temporarily).\n - Vani to tot up people's total expenses, and add it to the total to be paid in each Issue.\n - Jenn has been really busy elsewhere, and has not responded to queries about her planned interviews; so we can reallocate her interviewing budget to other people. We will also check whether anyone else apart from Jenn is dropping out; so we will find out async, and reassign budget to those who want to take on more interviews.\n\nAGI-24 conference payments:\n- Esther is still working to resolve how these payments (which are coming directly from the Foundation rather than via the WG budget) will be paid - people invoice directly, or money paid to Treasury and processed like a normal Ambassador Program payment?\n- Backup plan - look for one person who is able to invoice for all of it, and distribute it to others\n - Vani suggests mentioning this problem in our Q4 2024 quarterly report. Although it is nobody's fault, the uncertainty and delay on payments has lost us goodwill, both for the WG and for the Ambassador Program as a whole, especially since some of those who worked on it were new to the Program.\n\nGEI/BeGIN Open Office meetings documentation, Q3 - Jenn hasn't finished the task. Last meeting we said we would check if recordings were available and reassign the work - but on reflection, the task is not a priority, so it won't be reassigned, and the Q3 Issue will be closed and Jenn paid for the work she has done. In Q1 2025, we are no longer planning to document the Open Office meetings, as they're informal and rarely involve any decisions or action items.\n\nAI Ethics Forum moderation - Clement gave a quick update on some of the interesting topics covered in the forum, and suggested people have a read! He will give an update in his Issue, to include in the Quarterly Report.\n\nCo-Chair Mentee (Clement): Clement has worked with Vani on writing the Q1 2025 budget; and he has taken a lead on planning and managing the survey-sharing task. He said it was quite challenging at first to shape what the role should cover, but he came up with a list of things he is interested in doing in this position, including knowledge management, and working with Esther and LeeLoo on the interview process. Vani mentioned that we are planning to include some Knowledge Management planning as part of the Q1 2025 budget. We also clarified that the aim of the co-chair mentee role is to learn about BeGIN and Workgroup leadership, and for the mentee to then create an ongoing role for themselves, as Colleen did in Q3 with her focus on community engagement. \n\nCommunity Engagement Manager - Colleen gave a quick update: participation in the \"Death By AI\" game dropped a little because she was unavailable due to illness - but Advanceameyaw has stepped up as her backup. Colleen and Vani will have a DM conversation about ideas for the \"community event\" that is in the budget for this Quarter - we could approach Vasu and Kizzy re collaboration with AI Sandbox/Think Tank? Colleen will add an update in the GitHub issue on progress/direction before next meeting.\n\nEsther and Vani are writing an Interviewers' Handbook based on the training session and the validity criteria for interviews, which is almost done and ready to use. A draft is in \"Working docs\" for this meeting.\n\nQ1 2025 Budget: \n - Meeting facilitation will be folded into the Co-Chair role, so will not need an additional budget line\n - We have agreed not to document GEI/BGI Nexus Open Office meetings any more\n - We will focus on interview transcription in Q1, which will be done by the interviewers. Transcripts will need checking / proofreading - but (unless AGIX price rises significantly) this will be pushed to Q2 2025, as there's probably not sufficient budget to do it in Q1.\n - We will budget for around 30 interviews being transcribed in Q1 (not the whole 45 that we will have by then) and agreed to price it at $35 per interview\n - Interview coding: we might not get to this during Q1 - TBD whether to have a budget line for it this Quarter - maybe just some kind of planning meetings or ideation \n - We will keep our budget for new interviews small (suggest 5 interview-hours, or 10 interviews) and perhaps raising it to $30 per interview\n - Survey-sharing might not be a priority, so a small budget or not at all, but will aim to pick it up again in Q2\n - Ideation meetings on attracting donors to BeGIN Nexus - we will keep it to 3 people from the WG having 2 meetings with the BeGIN team\n - Knowledge management - ideally there will be some budget for it in Q1- the WG Admin Team will discuss async exactly what's needed here.\n ",

To begin with, he expressed his heartfelt appreciation to all those who consented to the Guild's Q4 budget proposal; however, he hinted that there are still some minor fittings to be made.\n\nQ4 Budget Walkthrough: Following that, we switched gears to tackle the Q4 budget proposal. With screen-sharing, Duke showcased the areas that needed to be funded, including but not limited to AMA sessions, task management, Town Hall updates, facilitation and documentation, projects, and initiatives! He also acknowledged and appreciated people who usually come to his DM to share cool ideas. He encourages such people to always come to meetings just so they can let the entire community be aware of their ideas.\n\nEvent Update: Duke shared an update on the forthcoming \"Ubuntu and AI\" event in Abuja, Nigeria; he mentioned that he would share a video with the community. Duke added that the initial participation threshold was 30 to 40 people; however, over 60 people have registered. To this effect, the team will have to shuffle names to select people who will attend in person randomly. More so, he said that he would share a form with the community to share their thoughts, concerns, and everything they’d like the team to consider. He urged everyone to register for the event and have them broadcast the event to other communities. Just so you know, registering for this event will give individuals access to stream the event virtually from the comfort of their homes. \n\n",

We also conducted a quick review of our documentation template, aiming for consistency and some form of uniformity as highlighted by the archives.\n\nQ4 Budget Updates: There was a brief discussion about reviewing our Q4 budget during the last meeting. It was also noted that the Focus Group will hold a meeting to finalize decisions on what should and should not be fitted.\n\nUpdate on Research for Developing Indigenous AI Tooling: The guild was reminded about the team that was set up to ideate the research for developing indigenous AI tooling, an extension of the partnership and integration effort that the guild is trying to work on to collaborate with the R&D Guild. The team, comprising Ayo, Emmanuel, Ese, and Onize, is expected to meet and provide updates to the guild. Clement advised them to start ideating early in order to refine their objectives, enabling the guild to approach the R&D for collaboration and support in the upcoming quarters.\n\nGuild Membership Cap: Duke clarified that the African Guild serves as a regional outreach arm within the Ambassador Program, similar to the LATAM Guild, and distinct from being a normal guild within the program. The conversation mainly focused on the idea of a guild membership cap, with discussions on the importance of setting a cap, possible criteria to look for, cap limit in terms of numbers, and what actions to take when the cap is reached.\n\nUpdate on Ubuntu and AI Event: Duke gave a thorough update on the Ubuntu and AI event with some guild members who participated sharing how transformative it was especially learning from the speakers and the excitement of meeting distant guild members in person. Whilst there is a high demand for its continuity, the guild plans to fine tune this with the community collective initiative.",

This prompted a conversation on the need for consistency in the documentation process. Duke suggested appointing someone to take on the role of Archivist. This person would be responsible for reviewing all our documentation since the project began, scrutinizing it, and helping to define a clear and consistent structure.\n\nUpdate on Research for Developing Indigenous AI Tooling: Onize gave an update that they have started making progress: they have drawn up their line of action and are awaiting a template from Ayo on the research. Duke highlighted the need for feedback on progress due to the time-sensitive nature of the project and the approaching deadline. He also requested a budget for the research so it can be properly allocated and fitted in the budget planning.\n\nUpdate on Ubuntu and AI conversation: Duke clarified that the feedback we have been getting is excellent and we have clearance to continue. If we are thinking about the next city aside from Abuja, it would be Lagos. It was brought to our notice that the recorded versions of the events are accessible and they are in the drive. \nFor our next iteration, Duke said that he had a theme he had come up with 'Ubuntu and AI memories of the future' although it is not set and may still change. \n\nUse of cameras during the meeting: There was a suggestion for people to have their cameras on during meetings. However, this was met with strong opposition from the majority of members.",

          "narrative": "Kickoff: The meeting commenced with light talk on the African music industry and we received a warm greeting from Duke, who welcomed all members.\n\nRecap of Meeting: Duke stated he had gone through the minutes and put it to everyone if there were any reservations on it. No one had reservations.\n\nOrganization and documentation of meeting summaries within the guild: Cjfrankie outlined the organization of meeting summaries in the Ambassador's Google drive, noting that folders have been created for each quarter. He also said that Tevo has asked the workgroup to provide an email address that will be used to give editing access.\nHe went on to say that documenters for every meeting should upload the documents to the relevant folder for the meeting, and the template being used should be in a continuance.\nDuke expressed concerns about redundancy of uploading summaries to both the Google drive and the Archives meeting summary tool, suggesting that all members with African Guild tag should have editing access (or the documenters).\n\nWe noted that the Ubuntu and AI event had concluded successfully, with plans to develop conference papers, case studies, and educational materials stemming from the event. Marketing and video collaboration efforts were discussed for promoting these materials.\n\nDiscussions also included plans for a Q4 AMA session, with ongoing efforts to solidify the details and budget for the event. \n\nThe meeting concluded with a note on membership caps and the need to finalize onboarding procedures.\n\nThe focus group expressed its anticipation for updates from the marketing group, emphasizing the importance of their intentions. The conversation then transitioned to the effectiveness of previous reporting styles, particularly regarding Q3 documents, which were criticized for lacking clarity and justification of the work done. A suggestion was made to enhance the documentation for Q4.\n\nUpdate on research on indigenous tooling: Ayo presented an update on research related to indigenous tooling and inclusivity within the SingularityNET ecosystem. He outlined three key strategies to expand sNET in Africa:\n- creating tools\n- onboarding builders\n- collaborating with existing solutions that address African problems. \n\nAyo emphasized the importance of conducting thorough research to identify community needs and solutions. He introduced execution process documents detailing how to develop Afrocentric tools, onboard social providers, and engage users, stressing the need for a structured approach to implementation.\nThe conversation shifted to concerns about onboarding new members, with Ayo clarifying that the aim is to integrate Africans into the ecosystem rather than specifically training ambassadors. He emphasized the importance of solving real-life problems and facilitating connections between solution providers and the community.\n\nUpdates on African guild GitHub repository: Sucre gave an update on migrating tasks to the African Guild GitHub repository, with a commitment to complete this by the end of the quarter.\n\nThe meeting continued with discussions around outstanding payments from previous weeks, emphasizing the importance of confirming that all members had received their payments due to budget constraints. The topic then shifted to the concept of restructuring payment schedules from a weekly to a monthly basis. A member highlighted the challenges of managing finances when payments are received weekly, citing cultural pressures like \"black tax\" that often fall on individuals earning more than the average local wage. This member proposed that monthly payments would allow for better financial planning. While some members expressed interest in this change, others preferred the current weekly payment system, citing concerns about potential complications with treasury processes.\n\nKenichi introduced an upcoming conference titled \"Blockchain in Unilag,\" aimed at promoting blockchain knowledge and connecting various communities. He highlighted the potential benefits for the African Guild, including opportunities for ambassadors to represent SingularityNET and to engage with developers and other blockchain communities. The discussion touched on the possibility of having a booth at the event to promote the ambassador program and gather insights from attendees. Kenichi outlined the booth's purpose: to conduct interviews, provide information about services, and promote engagement from the African community and beyond. The event aims to disseminate knowledge from an African perspective and encourage participation in the ecosystem without requiring attendees to participate in every meeting or conference. The event is happening on November 15th.\n",

First off, Duke gives credit to Martinsoki for documenting excellently; however, he pointed out that the summary has two different font styles! He added that meeting documenters should use “Nunito\" font as our standard.\n\nResearch updates: Advance shared an update on the “indigenous AI tooling research.” He added that Phase One of the research, which was about drafting process documents, has been completed. The research team is yet to embark on phase two.\n\nAMA Session: Clement shared insider tips on the AMA side of things. He hinted that decisions have been made on the forthcoming AMA session scheduled for November 29th. Speaking of time, the purpose of the AMA session, and the selection of speakers, there are several ongoing discussions. The session will feature engaging moments such as Q&A and other interactions from previous sessions. Lastly, he added that come the next meeting, the speakers will be selected; and the team will share more detailed updates.\n\nAOB: As a matter of finality and news worth mentioning, Duke announced the approval of his Deep Funding proposal, which aims to spread the word on SingularityNET in the African continent. Although it's a work in progress, he showcased the newly launched website (https://www.singularitynet.africa). He mentioned the impact of SingularityNET in African universities — the team has been working behind the scenes on this. He also showcased all the social media platforms while encouraging African Guild members to share their feedback and thoughts on the project. \n\nMore AOB: The meeting also featured the presence of Kenichi, who spoke about the forthcoming blockchain event at the University of Lagos (Unilag); he sought clarity on the number of African Guild members who will be live at the event. He also spoke about taking the discussion to Marketing Guild to ideate more, and the AI Ethics workgroup to see how they can support by providing merchandise from the Foundation or BeGIN for the event.\n\nDuke also discussed the forthcoming Virtual AGI conference scheduled for November which is the first of its kind on the African continent.\n",

Isaac Daniel was meant to be our documenter, but he was unavailable, so MartinSoki opted to step in. We glanced over the minutes from the last meeting summary; no one had any reservations. \n\nTripartite Partnership with African Guild: We had this partnership conversation in Q3 and now we are finalizing it, we are trying to work on the blueprint document. So, the African Guild is going to strike a partnership with three organizations, REMOSTART (https://www.remostarts.com/), STARHIVE (https://starhive.com/), and BETA AFRICA (https://beta.africa/). REMOSTART will be coming in as a technical partner - we are doing a lot of research and right now we are moving into actual development phases. STARHIVE comes in as a research partner, and we have BETA AFRICA as an educational partner. We are going to have these partnerships that will quest static over the period for which we will have a promotion of these AI tools that our team of brilliant people who are actually carrying out current research on how to work around this. We will be sending out letters to describe actual involvement and what we expect from them. We will bring it up here for everyone to have a more in-depth knowledge of when and where the boundaries for involvement are for us as a Guild and for them as independent organizations.    \n\nUpdates from Research on Indigenous Tooling: Onize said they are making progress on collecting responses but so far, they have had just one. She asked for more time so they can collect more data. Clement suggested reminding people via DM to give responses, as well as posting in the Discord channel; and tagging people by name in the channel. Onize agreed.\n\nQ4 A.M.A Session Update: Ese said they need to conclude on the speakers, and then they can start to publicise it. |The date is November 29th, 2024. Ese gave more detail on the event: that over time we have been discussing the need to Africanize AI tools, it is for Africa to step up their game. The focus of this A.M.A is practical action items to enable us to do all that we have discussed.\n\nUpdate on Marketing Initiatives: Ese said the marketing team are planning two initiatives, and will discuss with the Focus Group about implementing them - will it be in Q4, or in Q1 2025? The 2 initiatives are:\n\n- UGC (user-generated content) on a theme of cultural perspectives on the sNET ASI Alliance, i.e people from different places, creating images inspired by what they think of when they hear \"ASI\". There will be three winners. Ese will share the documentation by the weekend with the focus group before sharing it with the whole SNET community. Timescale: two weeks, so if it's approved then it should be happening the second week of November.\n\n- a Pan African Mega SingularityNet X space, with all the team being inside Africa. A way to onboard startups and AI builders into the SingularityNET platform. Aim to onboard about 10 companies to join the discussion, who do not yet have anything to do with SingularityNET but are building AI based solutions. Timescale: first week of December. \n\nDiscussion on Contest and Community Engagement: Ese is thinking of taking it outside the Ambassador program. We need people that are doing something else outside to jump on it. And also talk about the ASI alliance because it has not been talked about.\n",

Writers WG has resubmitted their budget proposal so we have to relaunch the consent process and Treasury Guild will set up the consent form and run it again. Do we as governance WG guide this or is it purely treasury conversation? It might be a good idea to have a consensus call or coordinate around the topic here. Another point raised was that if the objections raised during the last consent round have been addressed then there might be no need for another consent round but if they haven’t then that might be an issue. Vani suggested that we transfer all the things we said we would do to improve the quarter 3 consent process to our next meeting or Treasury Guild’s meeting to try and set up how to avoid these issues(stuff like having quarterly report handy, improving budget proposals structure/writing with maybe a template? and not hiding the link to your budget so no one can see it) in Q3. This could be on our next meeting agenda or the treasury’s agenda if they don't have something on their plate already.\n\nMarketing Guild Lead: Guild members are trying to figure out who will be the Guild Lead and there was no consensus at the end of last week's discussion. We noted that so many people are interested in the role but that wanting it is one thing and that having the ability and skills to step into the role is another thing. Peter mentioned that Judith posted a summary of the main ideas that came out of the last town hall session so everyone could check it out. Peter finalized by saying that in terms of the Marketing Guild Lead, we should go for someone who knows a bit if not much about the project and not just someone who reads about Web3 marketing:-)\n\nRetrospective across the Quarter: How will this work? We can have the session next week on what worked, and what didn't work plus suggestions for improvement. We can also do async with a form of Polis as agreed previously. Vani has drafted a starting point for the Polis session. She added that a few of us could go off and come back with fitting statements. Peter suggested having a WG Leads call to go through the proposal writing aspect. Vani reminded us that we had yet to decide on the renaming of the core contributor role and that if you sit on a decision for a while until it is accepted, you don't need to make a decision, but is that ethical? Is it fair? It was suggested we look at it as part of the reflective process.\n\nLoomio Test Run: We will go ahead with purchasing a subscription to the Loomio decision-making software and Core Contributors could simply use it to vote on items. Do we play around with it and see how it works for decision-making? There is currently a six-month contract and Deep Funding is currently exploring tools. Vani suggested making a little video about how it works and sharing that. Guillermo added that Judith shared it as it is something the whole SingularityNET community will be able to use. Felix suggested we focus on retrospective and ideating improvements for the next decision-making thing. Once this is done, we should ideally already have a nice list of stuff we want to do better, where we can see already, how can we do this directly through the first voting experiment on the renaming core contributor role thing with Loomio, and then we can move towards quarter three.\n\nWG Documentation: Is it possible to include adding meeting notes to the summary tool as part of the documentation of a meeting?

Meetings like that can get quite wordy to document and a bit tasky to facilitate. Peter did step up to facilitate and since he has done it before, we do not need any preparation.\nKareem’s Design Initiative Design Initiative: Kareem gave an overview of the initiative where he highlighted that the initiative is looking to solve the problem of unifying brand guidelines that has been in the program for a while.\nVani asked “What is the long-term sustainability for it?” Kareem responded that the core and starting point of the initiative is to create design stuff and have some kind of test run to see and observe its impact in the ambassador program. Vani then asked how Kareem plans on delivering a report on the initiative and what metrics he would use. She added that if he is testing running something there should be a way of assessing whether it's useful. Kareem emphasized that WGs have a way of showing their stats/numbers in terms of deliverables so this can be monitored from that.\nGuillermo asked if Kareen had gone back to discuss internally the whole point of “folding the design initiative into Marketing Guild” with the Marketing Guild to which Kareem replied that it's been addressed.  Kareem also clarified that the deliverables in the initiative document will be done this quarter(Q4).\nLove found Kareem's answer to long term goals and having the initiative folded in Marketing Guild unsatisfactory so Kareem clarified that they are for 1) trying to establish a very consistent style guide for designing which is the templates they want to create will come in and that depending on how the community feels about it they might move forward with newer things like motion graphics and illustration. 2)He spoke with the Marketing Guild and they have some sort of understanding that the initiative is something that is going to be under the Marketing Guild.\nWe also discussed how long the templates Kareem would be creating this quarter(q4) will last, he said they will be live and valid for like Q1. Vani pointed out a few of the templates(banners and visuals for announcement) that could be used for a longer period of time though.\nTheFreyDeFi suggested getting different WG leads to kind of spearhead and unify the whole design thing but still added that he likes Kareem’s design initiative under Marketing Guild. Kareem also emphasized that there is a content calendar to post on social media platforms for all WGs/Guilds under Marketing Guild already instead of having meetings to discuss it so it is properly organized.\nWe asked if anyone objects to this initiative becoming a reality and if they think it's unsafe to try. We had no outstanding objections.\n",
